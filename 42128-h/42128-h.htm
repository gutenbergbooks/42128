<h1>PHILOSOPHICAL JOURNAL.</h1>

<h3 class="p4 break"><a name="Art_1"></a><cite>Geographical Distribution of Animals.</cite></h3>
<p class="center">By Professor <span class="sc">Louis Agassiz</span>.</p>

<p class="p2">The greatest obstacles in the way of investigating the laws
of the distribution of organized beings over the surface of our
globe, are to be traced to the views generally entertained
about their origin. There is a prevailing opinion, which
ascribes to all living beings upon earth one common centre
of origin, from which it is supposed they, in the course of
time, spread over wider and wider areas, till they finally came
into their present state of distribution; and what gives this
view a higher recommendation, in the opinion of most men, is
the circumstance, that such a method of distribution is considered
as revealed in our sacred writings. We hope, however,
to be able to shew that there is no such statement in
the Book of Genesis; that this doctrine of a unique centre of
origin, and successive distribution of all animals is of very
modern invention; and that it can be traced back for scarcely
more than a century in the records of our science.</p>

<p>There is another view to which, more recently, naturalists
have seemed to incline; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the assuming several centres of
origin, from which organized beings were afterwards diffused
over wider areas, in the same manner as according to the
first theory, the difference being only in the assumption of
several centres of dispersion instead of a single one.</p>

<p>We have recently been led to take a very different view of
the subject, and shall presently illustrate the facts upon
which the view rests. But before we undertake to introduce
more directly this subject, there is another point which requires
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>preliminary investigation, which seems to have been
entirely lost sight of by all those, without exception, who
have studied the geographical distribution of animals, and
which seems to us to be the keystone of the whole edifice,
whenever we undertake to reconstruct the primitive plan of
the geographical distribution of animals and plants. The
distribution of organized beings over the surface of our globe
in its present condition cannot be considered in itself; and
without an investigation, at the same time, of the geographical
distribution of those organized beings which have existed
in former geological periods, and had become extinct before
those of the present creation were called into being. For it
is well ascertained now that there is a natural succession in
the plan of creation&mdash;an intimate connection between all the
types of the different periods of the creation from its beginning
up to this day; so much so, that the present distribution
of animals and plants is the continuation of an order of things
which prevailed for a time at an earlier period, but which
came to an end before the existing arrangement of things
was introduced.</p>

<p>The animal kingdom, as we know it in our days, is therefore
engrafted upon its condition in earlier periods; and it is
to the distribution of animals in these earlier periods that we
must look, if we would trace the plan of the Creator from
its commencement to its more advanced development in our
own time.</p>

<p>If there is any truth in the view that animals and plants
originated from a common centre, it must be at the same
time shewn that such an intimate connection between the
animals existed at all periods; or, at least, we should, before
assuming such a view for the animals living in our days,
discover a sufficient reason for ascribing to them another
mode of dispersion than to the animals and plants of former
periods. But there is such a wonderful harmony in all the
great processes of nature, that, at the outset, we should be
carefully on our guard against assuming different modes of
distribution for the organized beings of former periods, and
for those which at present cover the globe. Should it be plain
that the animals and plants did not originate from a common
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>centre at the beginning of the creation, and during the different
successive geological periods, we have at once a strong
indication that neither has such been the case with the animals
of the present day; and, on the other hand, if there
were satisfactory evidence that the animals and plants now
living originated from a common centre, we should consider
the matter carefully before trusting to the views derived from
geological facts. Let us, therefore, examine first the value of
the evidence on both sides.</p>

<p>We have already expressed, and we repeat here, our earnest
belief that the view of a unique centre of origin and distribution
rests chiefly upon the supposed authority of the Mosaic
record; and is in no way sustained by evidence derived from
investigations in natural history. On the contrary, wherever
we trace the animals in their present distributions, we find
them scattered over the surface of our globe in such a manner,
according to such laws, and under such special adaptations,
that it would baffle the most fanciful imagination to conceive
such an arrangement as the mere results of migrations, or of
the influence of physical causes over the dispersion of both
animals and plants. For we find that all animals and plants
of the arctic zones agree in certain respects and are uniform
over the three continents which verge towards the northern
pole, whilst those of the temperate zone agree also in certain
respects, but differ somewhat from each other within definite
limits, in the respective continents. And the differences grow
more and more prominent as we approach the tropical zone,
which has its peculiar Fauna and Flora in each continent; so
much so, that it is impossible for us to conceive such a normal
arrangement, unless it be the result of a premeditated plan,
carried out voluntarily according to predetermined laws.</p>

<p>The opinion which is considered as the Biblical view of the
case, and according to which all animals have originated in
a common centre, would leave us at a loss for any cause by
which to account for the special dispersion of animals and
plants beyond the mere necessity of removing from the
crowded ground to assume wider limits, as their increased
number made it constantly more and more necessary and imperative.
According to this view, the animals of the arctic
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>zone as well as those of the tropics,&mdash;those of America as
well as those of New Holland,&mdash;have been first created upon
the high lands of Iran, and have taken their course in all
directions, to settle where they are now found to be strictly
limited. It does not appear how such migrations of polar
animals could have taken place over the warmer tracts of
land which they had to cross, and in which they cannot even
be kept alive, in our days, with the utmost precautions: nor
how the terrestrial animals of New Holland, which have no
analogies in the main continents, could have reached that
large island, nor why they should have all moved thither.
And, indeed, it is impossible, with such a theory, to account,
either for the special adaptation of types to particular districts
of the earth's surface, or for the limited distribution of so
many species which are found only over narrow districts in
their present arrangement. It is inconsistent with the structure,
habits, and natural instincts of most animals, even to
suppose that they could have migrated over any great distances.
It is in complete contradiction with the laws of nature,
and all we know of the changes our globe has undergone,
to imagine that the animals have actually adapted themselves
to their various circumstances during their migration,
as this would be ascribing to physical influences as much
power as to the Creator himself.</p>

<p>And, again, the regular distribution, requiring precise laws,
as we find it does, cannot be attributed either to the voluntary
migration of animals, or to the influence of physical
causes, when we see so plainly that this distribution is in accordance
with the geographical distribution of animals and
plants in former geological periods. But about this presently.
We will only add, that we cannot discover in the Mosaic account
anything to sustain such a view, nor even hints leading
to such a construction. What is said of animals and
plants in the first chapter of Genesis, what is mentioned of
the preservation of these animals and plants at the time of
the deluge, relates chiefly to organized beings placed about
Adam and Eve, and those which their progeny had domesticated,
and which lived with them in closer connection.</p>

<p>Let us now look at the results of geological investigations
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>respecting the origin of earlier races of animals and plants.
It is satisfactorily ascertained at present, that there have been
many distinct successive periods, during each of which large
numbers of animals and plants have been introduced upon
the surface of our globe, to live and multiply for a time, then
to disappear and be replaced by other kinds. Of such distinct
periods, such successive creations, we now know at least
about a dozen, and there are ample indications that the inhabitants
of our globe have been successively changed at more
epochs than are yet fully ascertained. But whether the number
of these distinct successive creations be twelve or twenty,
the fact stands in full light and evidence, that animals and
plants which lived during the first period disappeared, either
gradually or successively, to make room for others, and this
at often-repeated intervals; and that the existence of animals
and plants which live now is of but recent origin, is equally
well ascertained.</p>

<p>There is another series of phenomena, not less satisfactorily
established, which go to shew that the extent of dry
land rising above the surface of the ocean has neither been
equally extensive at all times, nor has it had the same outline
at all periods. On the contrary, we know that, early in
the history of our globe, there has been a period, when but
few low groups of islands existed above the surface of the
ocean, which, through successive elevation and depression,
have gradually enlarged and modified the extent and form of
the mainland.</p>

<p>Again, in examining the remains of organized beings preserved
in the different strata constituting the solid crust of
our globe, we find that at each period, animals and plants
were distributed in the ocean and over the mainland in a
particular manner, characteristic of every great epoch. A
closer uniformity in their distribution is found in the earlier
deposits, so much so that the oldest fossils discovered in the
southern extremity of Africa, on the eastern and southern
shores of New Holland, and in Van Diemen's Land, in North
America, or in various parts of Europe, are almost identical,
or at least so nearly related, that they resemble each other
much more than the animals and plants which at present
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>live in the same countries; shewing that uniformity in the
aspect of the surface of the globe, as well as in the nature of
animals and plants, was at first the prevailing rule, and that,
whatever was the primitive region of these animals and plants,
their types occupied much more extensive districts than any
race of living beings during later periods. Are we to infer
from this fact, that, at that period, these animals and plants
originated from one common centre, and were distributed
equally all over the globe? By no means. Though slight,
we find nevertheless such differences among them in distant
parts of the world as would rather sustain the view of an
adaptation in the earliest creations to more uniform circumstances,
than that of one centre of origin for all animals and
plants of those days. During later periods, indeed, we find
from geological evidence that large islands had been formed,
more extensive tracts of land elevated above the surface of
the ocean, and the remains both of the animals and plants
derived from these different regions present already marked
differences when we compare them with each other,&mdash;varieties
similar to those which exist between the respective continents
at present, though perhaps less marked. Shall we here again
assume that animals and plants originated from another
centre, or from the same centre as those of former periods, to
migrate over those different parts of the world, through the
sea as well as over land? It is impossible to arrive at such
a conclusion, when we consider the distribution of fossil remains
in the more recent geological deposits, or in those
strata which were formed during the latest geological periods,
immediately before the present creation. For we find in
these comparatively modern beds a distribution of fossil remains
which agrees in a most remarkable manner with the
present geographical arrangement of animals and plants.
For instance, the fossils of modern geological periods in New
Holland are of the same types as most of the animals now
living there. Again, the recent fossils of Brazil belong to the
same families as those prevailing at present in Brazil; though,
in both cases, fossil species are distinct from living ones. If,
therefore, the organized beings of the recent geological periods
had arisen from one central point of distribution, to be dispersed
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>and finally to become confined to those countries
where their remains are found in a fossil condition, and if the
animals now living had also spread from a common origin over
the same districts, and had then been circumscribed within
equally distinct limits, we should be led to the unnatural
supposition, that animals of two distinct creations, differing
specifically throughout, had taken the same lines of migration,
had assumed finally the same distribution, and had become
permanent in the same regions, without any other
inducement for their removal and final settlement than the
mere necessity of covering more extensive ground after they
had become too numerous to remain any longer together in
one and the same district. This were to ascribe to the animals
themselves, or to the physical agents under which they
live, and by which they may be influenced, as much wisdom,
as much providential forethought, as is evinced throughout
nature, both in the distribution of animals, and in their special
adaptation to particular portions of the globe in which they
are closely circumscribed at present, and to which they were
limited under similar circumstances during those periods
which preceded immediately the present arrangement of
things. Now these facts in themselves leave not the shadow
of a doubt in our mind, that animals were primitively created
all over the world, within those districts which they were
naturally to inhabit for a certain time. The next question is&mdash;were
these organized beings created in pairs, as is generally
thought and believed? The opinion, that all animals must
be<a name= "fnanchor_N1" id= "fnanchor_N1"></a><a href= "#footnote_N1" class= "fnanchor">[N1]</a> referred to one single, primitive pair, is derived from evidence
worthy of consideration, no doubt, but the value of
which may fairly be questioned by naturalists; since this
point, at least if we except Adam and Eve, is entirely of
human construction, and only assumed because it is thought
to shew a wise economy of means in the established order of
things which exists. It is supposed, that, if one pair were
sufficient, there is no reason why the Creator should have
introduced at one time a greater number of each kind, as
economy of means is always considered an indication of high
wisdom. But are not these human considerations? And if
they are, and if we are entitled to question their value, let us
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>see how they answer the object which was intended, namely,
the peopling of the whole world with various races of organized
beings.</p>

<p>Whenever we consider the economy of nature, we observe
great varieties in the habits of different animals. There are,
indeed, some which live constantly in pairs, and which by
nature are designed to perpetuate their races in that way,
and to spread generation after generation over their natural
boundaries, thus mated. But there are others to which it is
equally natural to live in herds or shoals, and which we never
find isolated. The idea of a pair of herrings, or of a pair of
buffaloes, is as contrary to the nature and habits of those
animals<a name= "fnanchor_N2" id= "fnanchor_N2"></a><a href= "#footnote_N2" class= "fnanchor">[N2]</a>, as it is contrary to the nature of pines and birches
to grow singly, and to form forests in their isolation.</p>

<p>But we can go further. There are animals in which the
number of individuals of different sexes is naturally unequal,
and among which there are either constantly more males or
constantly more females born, as the result of their peculiar
nature and habits in the creation. A bee-hive never consists
of a pair of bees; and never could such a pair preserve the
species, with their habits. For them it is natural to have one
female and many males devoted to it, and thousands of neutral
bees working for them. And this is the natural original
mode of existence among that species of animals, which it
would be utterly contrary to the laws of nature to consider as
derived from a single pair. There are a number of birds, on
the contrary, in which only a few males are universally found
with many females, living together in companies, such as the
pheasants, and our domesticated fowls. It were easy to multiply
examples in order to shew that a creation of all animals
in pairs would have been contrary to their very nature, as we
observe it in all. To assume that they have changed this
nature would be to fall back upon the necessity of ascribing
to physical influences a power which they do not possess,&mdash;that
of producing changes in the very nature of organized
beings, and of modifying the primitive plan of the Creator.</p>

<p>Again, there are animals which, by nature, are impelled to
feed upon other animals. Was the primitive pair of lions
to abstain from food until the gazelles and other antelopes had
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>sufficiently multiplied to preserve their races from the persecution
of these ferocious beasts? Were all animals, and the
innumerable tribes of ferocious fishes which live upon smaller
ones, to abstain from food till these had been multiplied to a
sufficient extent to secure their preservation? Or were, perhaps,
the carnivorous animals created only at a later period?
But we find them everywhere together. They constitute
natural, harmonious groups with the herbivorous tribes, both
in the waters and on land, preserving among each other such
proportions as will maintain for ages an undisturbed harmony
in the creation.</p>

<p>Again, we find animals and plants occurring in distinct
districts, unconnected with each other, in such ways that it
would seem almost impossible for either to migrate from any
point of their natural circle of distribution over its whole surface.
Have, for instance, such animals as are found identical
both in America and Europe been created either in Europe
or in America, and wandered from one of the continents over
to the other? Have those species which occur only in the
far north, and upon the higher summits of the Alps, been
created either in the Alps or in the north, and wandered from
one place to the other? We are at a loss for substantial
arguments for believing that either one or the other place has
been the primitive location of such animals, or for denying
their simultaneous creation in both.</p>

<p>Evidence could be accumulated to shew, we will not say
the improbability only, but even the impossibility, of supposing
that animals and plants were created in single pairs, and
assumed afterwards their present distribution. But the facts
mentioned will be sufficient to introduce our argument, and
from all we know of the laws of nature and of the distribution
of animals, we conclude that they could neither originate
from a single pair, nor upon a single spot. And as for plants,
we would ask naturalists whether it were not superfluous to
create more than a single stalk of most plants, as vegetables,
with a few exceptions, may multiply extensively from a single
stem. But if it is granted that animals could not originate
from a single pair, nor upon a single spot, what is the more
natural view to take of the subject?</p>

<p><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>Without entering fully into this question, we may as well
state that we have been gradually led to the conclusion, that
most animals and plants must have originated primitively over
the whole extent of their natural distribution. We mean to
say that, for instance, lions, which occur over almost the
whole of Africa, over extensive parts of Southern Asia, and
were formerly found even over Asia-Minor and Greece, must
have originated primitively over the whole range of these
limits of their distribution. We are led to these conclusions
by the very fact, that the lions of the East Indies differ somewhat
from those of Northern Africa; these, again, differ
from those of Senegal. It seems more natural to suppose
that they were thus distributed over such wide districts, and
endowed with particular characteristics in each, than to
assume that they constituted as many species; or to believe
that, created anywhere in this circle of distribution, they have
gradually been modified to their present differences in consequence
of their migration. We admit these differences to be
primitive and contemporaneous, from the fact, that there are
other animals of different genera extending over the same
tracts of land which have different representatives in each,
circumscribed within narrower bounds, and this particular
combination in each special district of the wider circle covered
by the lion, seems, in our opinion, the strongest argument in
favour of the view, that the particular districts of distribution
have been primitively ascribed, with definite limits, to each
species. Why should the antelopes north of the Cape of
Good Hope differ from those of Arabia, or those of the Senegal,
or those of the Atlas, or those of the East Indies, if
they were not primitively adapted with their special modifications
to those districts, when we see the lion cover the whole
range? And why should the varieties we notice among the
lions within these boundaries not be primitive, though not
constituting distinct species, when we see the herbivorous
species of the same genus differ from one district to another?
And why should the differences in that one species of lion be
the result of changes in its primitive character, arising from its
distribution into new districts, when we see that the antelopes
are at once fixed as distinct species over the same ground?</p>

<p><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>This argument cannot be fully appreciated by those who
are not extensively acquainted with natural history, but we
may, perhaps, make it plainer by alluding to some other
similar facts. Our fresh waters teem everywhere with
animals and plants. Fishes and mollusca are among the
most prominent of their animals. Let us compare for a
moment the different species which occur in the Danube, in
the Rhine, and in the Rhone, three hydrographic basins entirely
unconnected with each other throughout their whole
extent. They spring from the same mountain chain, as we
may take the Inn as the source of the Danube. These three
great rivers rise within a few miles of each other. Nevertheless,
most of their fishes differ, but there are some which are
common to the three. We find the pickerel,&mdash;the European
pickerel, in the three basins. The eel is also common to
them all. One kind of trout occurs in the three. But how
strange the distribution of some others!&mdash;for instance, the
perches. In the Rhine we find <i>Perca fluviatilis</i>, and <i>Acerina
cernua</i>; in the Rhone, <i>Perca fluviatilis</i>, and <i>Aspro vulgaris</i>; in
the Danube, <i>Perca vulgaris</i>, <i>Lucio-perca Sandra</i>, <i>Acerina cernua</i>,
<i>A. Schraitzer</i>, <i>Aspro vulgaris</i>, and <i>A. Zingel</i>. If these
animals had not originated in these rivers separately, why
should not such closely-allied species, some of which occur in
the three basins, have all spread equally into them? and if
they originated in the separate basins, we have within close
limits a multiple origin of the same species.</p>

<p>And that this multiple origin must be admitted as a fact
is shewn by the following further evidence. Among the
carpes we find, for instance, <i>Barbus</i>, <i>Gobio</i>, <i>Carpio</i>, common
to the three. But the Danube has three <i>Gobios</i>, whilst the
others have but one, one of the Danube being identical with
the one of the other two rivers. The most striking fact,
however, occurs in the genus <i>Leuciscus</i>. <i>Leuciscus dobula</i> is
common to the three; but in addition to it, the Danube has
several species which occur neither in the Rhine nor in the
Rhone. The basin of the Rhone, again, has several species
which occur neither in the Danube nor in the Rhine; and in
the Rhine, there are species which belong neither to the
Rhone nor to the Danube. Now, we ask, could all these
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>species of <i>Leuciscus</i> have been created in one of the basins,&mdash;in
the Danube for instance,&mdash;and have migrated in such a way,
that a certain number of the species should remain solely in
the Danube, while some others left the Danube altogether
to settle finally only in the Rhone, and others to settle only
in the Rhine; that one accompanying those species peculiar
to the Rhone, remained in the Danube with those species
peculiar to it, and settled also in the Rhone, with those
species peculiar to that river, and also in the Rhine with the
species peculiar to the Rhine? And whether we assume the
Rhone as the primitive centre, instead of the Danube or the
Rhine, the argument holds equally good. We have one
species common to the three rivers, and several species peculiar
to each, which could never have migrated (if migration
took place) in such a manner as to assume their present
combinations. But if, on the contrary, we suppose that all
the species originated in the rivers where they occur, then
we have again a multiple origin of that species which is
common to the three, for it were wonderful if that one alone
had migrated, when they are all so closely allied. Here,
again, we arrive at the conclusion, that the same species can
have a multiple origin, in the same manner as, from the considerations
alluded to before, we have decided that species
do not originate from single pairs, but in their natural proportion
with the other species with which they live simultaneously
over the whole ground which they cover. And
this is the view which we take of the natural distribution of
animals, that they originated primitively over the whole extent
of their natural distribution; that they originated there,
not in pairs, but in large numbers, in such proportions as
suits their natural mode of living, and the preservation of
species; and that the same species may have originated in
different unconnected parts of the more extensive circle of
their distribution. We are well aware that there are very
many species which are known to have spread beyond what
we would call their natural limits; species which did not
occur in North America before the settlement of the whites,
that are now abundant here over very extensive tracts of
country; other species which have been introduced from
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>America into Europe, and also into other parts of the world,
in different ways. But these are exceptional facts; and,
what is more important, these changes in the primitive distribution
of organised beings, both animals and plants, have
taken place under the influence of man,&mdash;under the influence
of a being acting not merely from natural impulses, or under
the pressure of physical causes, but moved by a higher will.
So that these apparent exceptions to the rule would only
go to confirm it; as, within the limits of these secondary
changes, we see a will acting, just as we consider that the
primitive distribution of all organized beings has been the result
of the decrees of the Creator, and not the result of mere
natural influences.</p>

<p>Having thus led the way to what we would consider as a
fairer ground for investigating the natural geographical distribution
of animals and plants, let us now examine the
natural lines which seem to regulate this distribution. Nothing
can be more striking to the observer than the fact, that
animals, though endowed with the power of locomotion, remain
within fixed bounds in their geographical distribution,
although an unbounded field for migration is open to them in
all directions, over land, through the air, and through the
waters. And no stronger argument can be introduced to shew
that living beings are endowed with their power of locomotion
to keep within general boundaries, rather than to spread
extensively. There is another fact which shews that animals
are made to remain within these natural limits. We would
allude especially to the difficulty we experience whenever we
attempt to transport animals from their native country into
other countries, even if we secure for them as nearly as can
be the same conditions in which they used to live. Again,
observe the changes which animals undergo when they are
once acclimatized to countries different from their native
land. There can be no more striking evidence of this than
the endless variety of our domestic animals, and there is no
subject which more requires a renewed and careful investigation
than this. We do not, however, feel competent to
introduce this point more fully to the notice of our readers.
Some facts bearing upon the question may best be mentioned
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>in a reference to the different animals which man has thus
made subservient to his social condition. We shall here
allude only to the laws of distribution of wild animals in
their natural condition.</p>

<p>It has already been stated, that the present distribution of
animals agrees with the distribution of extinct types belonging
to earlier geological periods, so that the laws which regulate
the geographical distribution of animals seem to have
been the same at all times, though modified in accordance
with the successive changes which the animal kingdom has
undergone from the earliest period of its creation to the present
day. The universal law is, that all animals are circumscribed
within definite limits. There is not one species which
is uniformly spread all over the globe, either among the
aquatic races or among the terrestrial ones. Of the special
distribution of man, who alone is found everywhere, we shall
speak hereafter. The special adaptation of animals to certain
districts is not merely limited to the individual species.
We observe a similar adaptation among genera, entire families,
and even whole classes. For instance, all <i>Polypi</i>, <i>Medusæ</i>,
and <i>Echinoderms</i>, that is to say all <i>Radiata</i>, without
exception, are aquatic.<a name= "fnanchor_1" id= "fnanchor_1"></a><a href= "#footnote_1" class= "fnanchor">[1]</a> That large group of animals has not
a single terrestrial representative upon any point of the surface
of the globe; and during all periods of the history of
our earth, we find that they have always been limited to the
liquid element. And they are not only aquatic, they are
chiefly marine, as but exceedingly few of them are found in
fresh waters. Among <i>Mollusca</i> we find almost the same
adaptation. Their element also is the sea. The number of
fresh-water species is small, compared with that of marine
types; and we find terrestrial species in only one of their
classes. In former periods, also, <i>Mollusca</i> were chiefly marine;
fluviatile and terrestrial types occurring only in more recent
periods.</p>

<p><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>With the <i>Articulata</i>, we find another state of things. Two
of their classes, the worms and <i>Crustacea</i>, are chiefly marine,
or at least aquatic, as we have a number of fresh-water
worms, and some fresh-water <i>Crustacea</i>. But insects are, for
the most part, chiefly terrestrial, feeding upon terrestrial
plants, at least in their full-grown condition; though a large
number of these animals are fluviatile, and even some marine,
during their earlier periods of life. In the <i>Vertebrata</i>, the
adaptations are more diversified. Only one class of these
animals is entirely aquatic&mdash;the fishes; and the number of
the marine species is far greater than that of the fresh-water
kinds. Among reptiles there are many which are aquatic,
either throughout life, or through the earlier period of their
existence. But, as if animal life rose to higher organization,
as it leaves the ocean to inhabit dry land or fresh waters, we
find that the greater number of the aquatic reptiles are
fluviatile, and but a few marine. This fact agrees wonderfully
with the natural gradation of the classes already mentioned.
The lower type of animals, the <i>Radiata</i>, is almost
exclusively marine. Among <i>Mollusca</i>, we have a greater
number of marine types, a large number of fluviatile species,
and fewer terrestrial, and these are the highest in their class.
Again, among <i>Articulata</i>, the lower classes, worms and <i>Crustacea</i>,
are marine, or at least fluviatile, whilst the highest
class, that of insects, is chiefly terrestrial or fluviatile, during
the earlier periods of their growth. Among the <i>Vertebrata</i>
we see the lowest form, that of fishes, entirely aquatic, and
the same rule applies partially to the reptiles; but as the
class rises, the number of the fluviatile species is greater than
that of the marine types. Next, among birds, which by their
structure are exclusively adapted to live in the atmospheric
air, we find the larger number to be terrestrial, and only
the lower ones to live upon water, or dive occasionally into
it, always seeking the surface, however, to breathe and to perform
their most important vital functions. It is, nevertheless,
not a little strange, that this class should by nature be
adapted to rise into the air, just as if the first tendency towards
liberating them from the aquatic element had been
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>carried to an excess, and gave them a relation to the earth
which no other class, as a whole, holds to that degree, except,
perhaps, the insects, which are placed among the <i>Articulata</i>
in the same relation to the lower classes and the natural
element, which the class of birds maintains among <i>Vertebrata</i>.
The highest class of <i>Vertebrata</i> affords us examples of these
three modes of adaptation, the lowest of these being entirely
aquatic, and even absolutely marine; next, we have fluviatile
types of the large terrestrial mammalia, in the family of
<i>Manatees</i>, again, a swimming family among Carnivora,
another flying, most of them however walking upon their
four extremities on solid ground, but at the head of all, man,
standing upright, to look freely upwards, and to contemplate
the whole universe.</p>

<p>This wonderful adaptation of the whole range of animals,
as it exists at present, shews the most intimate connection
with the order of succession of animals in former geological
periods. The four great types, <i>Radiata</i>, <i>Mollusca</i>, <i>Articulata</i>,
and <i>Vertebrata</i>, were introduced at the beginning simultaneously.
However, the earliest representatives of these
great types were all aquatic. We find in the lowest beds
which contain fossils, <i>Polypi</i>, together with star-fishes, bivalve
shells, univalves, chambered shells, cases of worms,
and <i>Crustacea</i>, being representatives of at least seven out of
nine classes of invertebrate animals, if we are not allowed to
suppose that <i>Medusæ</i> existed also, and if insects were still
wanting for a time. But, in addition to these, fishes among
<i>Vertebrata</i> are introduced, but fishes only, all of which are
exclusively marine. At a somewhat later period insects come
in. We find next reptiles in addition to fishes&mdash;the lower
classes, or invertebrates, continuing to be represented through
all subsequent epochs, but by species changing gradually at
each period, as all classes do after they have been once introduced.
The first representatives among reptiles are marine,
next huge terrestrial ones, some, perhaps, flying types, and
with them, and perhaps even before them, birds, allied to
the wading tribes: still later, <i>Mammalia</i>, beginning again
with marine and huge terrestrial types, followed by the
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>higher quadrupeds; and, last only, Man,&mdash;at the head of the
creation, in time as well as in eminence, by structure, intelligence,
and moral endowments.</p>

<p>Besides the general adaptation of animals to the surrounding
media, there is a more special adaptation, which seems not
less important, though it is perhaps less striking. Animals,
as well as plants, do not live equally at all depths of the
ocean, or at all heights above its surface. There must be a
deep influence upon the geographical distribution of animals
in a vertical direction derived from atmospheric pressure
above the surface of the waters, and from the pressure of the
water itself at greater and greater depths,&mdash;the level of the
ocean, or a small elevation above its surface, or a shallow
depth under its surface, being the field of the most extensive
and intensive development of animal life. And it is not a
little remarkable that in the same classes we should find
lower types at greater depths in the ocean, and also lower
types at greater heights above. We will quote a few
examples, to shew how much we may expect from investigations
pursued in this direction, for at present we have but
little information which can aid us in ascertaining the relationship
between atmospheric and hydrostatic pressure and
the energies of animal life.</p>

<p>Among <i>Polypi</i>, the higher forms, such as <i>Actiniæ</i>, are more
abundant in shallow water than the lower coral-forming
types. Among <i>Medusæ</i>, the young are either attached to
the bottom, or grow from the depth, while the perfect free
forms of these animals come to the surface. Among <i>Echinoderms</i>,
the <i>Crinoids</i> are deep-water forms; free star-fishes
and <i>Echini</i>, and, above all <i>Holothuriæ</i>, living nearer the surface.
Among <i>Mollusca</i>, the <i>Acephala</i>, which are lowest, have
their lower types,&mdash;the <i>Brachiopods</i>, entirely confined to deep
waters; the <i>Monomyarians</i> appear next, and, above them,
the <i>Dimyarians</i>; among these latter, the highest family,
the <i>Nayades</i>, rises above the level of the ocean into the fresh
waters, and extends even to considerable heights above the
sea, in lakes and rivers. A number of examples of all classes
should be mentioned, to shew that this is the universal case;
as, for instance, among <i>Crustacea</i> the <i>Macrura</i> are, in general
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>species of deeper water than the true crabs, of which
some come even upon dry land. Again, on the slopes of our
mountains, the highest forms among <i>Mammalia</i> which remain
numerous are the <i>Ruminants</i> and <i>Rodents</i>. There are no
<i>Carnivora</i> living in high regions. Among birds of prey, we
have the vultures, rising above the highest summits of mountains,
while eagles and falcons hover over the woods and
plains, by the water sides, and along the sea-shores. Among
reptiles, salamanders, frogs, and toads occur higher than any
turtles, lizards, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> But the same adaptation may be traced
with reference to the latitudes under which animals are
found. Those of the higher latitudes, the arctic and antarctic
species, resemble both the animals of high, prominent mountain
chains, and those of the deep sea-waters, which there
meet in the most unexpected combinations (and it is surprising
to see how extensively this is the case); while, in lower
latitudes, towards the tropics, we find everywhere the higher
representatives of the same families. For instance, among
<i>Mammalia</i> we observe monkeys only in warm latitudes, and they
die out in the warmer parts of the temperate zone. The great
development of <i>Digitigrades</i>&mdash;lions, tigers, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, takes place
within the tropics, smaller species, like wolves and foxes,
weasels, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, occurring in the north, whilst the <i>Plantigrades</i>,
which come nearer and nearer to the seal, follow an inverse
progression, the largest and most powerful of them being the
arctic ice bear, which meets there his family relations, the
<i>Pinnipedia</i>, that are so numerous in the polar regions. Again,
the families of <i>Ruminants</i> and <i>Pachyderms</i> seem to form an
exception, for though belonging to the lower types of <i>Mammalia</i>,
they prevail in the tropical zone; but let us remember
that they were among the earlier inhabitants of our globe,
and the fact of their occurring more extensively in warm
climates is rather a reminiscence of the plan of creation in
older times, than an adaptation to the law regulating at present
the distribution of organized beings. The gradation of
animals among birds being less satisfactorily ascertained, we
do not venture to say anything respecting their geographical
distribution, in relation to climates. But among reptiles,
we cannot overlook the fact, that the crocodiles, which are
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>the highest in structure, are altogether<a name= "fnanchor_N3" id= "fnanchor_N3"></a><a href= "#footnote_N3" class= "fnanchor">[N3]</a> tropical, and the <i>Batrachians</i>,
which rank lowest, especially the salamandroid
forms, are rather types of the colder temperate zone than of
the warm, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> From these facts it is plain, that the geographical
distribution of all groups has a direct reference to
atmospheric and hydrostatic pressure on one side, and also
to the intensity of light and heat over the surface of the
globe.</p>

<p>The special adaptation of minor groups begins very early in
the history of our globe, and extends at present all over its
surface. In the same manner as animals are adapted to
natural limits in their large primitive groups which we call
classes, we find also the minor divisions more closely adapted
to particular circumstances of the physical condition of all
parts of the globe. Among <i>Mammalia</i>, the great type of
<i>Marsupialia</i> is placed in New Holland, and extends little
beyond that continent into the adjacent islands. A very few
representatives of that family are found in America. Asia,
Africa, the colder parts of North America, and its southern
extremity, are entirely deprived of this type. The family of
<i>Edentata</i>, again, has its centre of development in South
America, where the sloth, dasypus, ant-eaters, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, form characteristic
types, of which a few analogues occur in Africa,
along its southern extremity and western coast. Now it is
a fact upon which we cannot insist too strongly, that the
same districts of New Holland and South America were,
during an earlier geological period comparatively recent, the
seat of an equally wide development of the same animals in
the same extensive proportion as at present. We need only
refer to the beautiful investigations of Dr Lund, upon the
fossil mammalia of Brazil, and to those, no less important, of
Professor Owen, upon the fossil remains of mammalia of
New Holland, to leave not a shadow of doubt upon this
adaptation, which indicates distinctly these two regions, at
two distinct periods remote from each other, as the points of
development of two distinct families, which have never spread
over other parts of the globe at any period since the time of
their existence, indicating at least two distinct foci of creation,
with the same characters, at two successive epochs; a
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>fact which, in our opinion, can never be reconciled to the
idea of a unique centre of origin of the animals now living.
But though other families have never been and are
not now localized in so special a manner, we nevertheless
find them circumscribed within certain limits, in particular
districts, or, at least, in particular zones.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the monkeys are entirely tropical.
But here, again, we notice a very intimate adaptation of their
types to the particular continents, as the monkeys of tropical
America constitute a family altogether distinct from the
monkeys of the Old World, there being not one species of
any of the genera of <i>Quadrumana</i>, so numerous on this continent,
found either in Africa or in Asia. The monkeys of the
Old World, again, constitute a natural family by themselves,
extending equally over Africa and Asia; but the species of
Africa differ from those of Asia; and there is even a close
representative analogy between those of different parts of
these two continents; the orangs of Africa, the chimpanzee
and gorilla, corresponding to the red orang of Sumatra and
Borneo, and the smaller long armed species of continental
Asia. And what is not a little remarkable is the fact, that
the black orang occurs upon that continent which is inhabited
by the black human race, whilst the brown orang inhabits
those parts of Asia over which the chocolate-coloured Malays
have been developed. There is again a peculiar family of
<i>Quadrumana</i> confined to the Island of Madagascar&mdash;the makis&mdash;which
are entirely peculiar to that island, and the eastern
coast of Africa opposite to it, and to one spot on the western
shore of Africa. But in New Holland, and the adjacent
islands, there are no monkeys at all, though the climatic
conditions seem not to exclude their existence any more
than those of the large Asiatic islands, upon which such high
types of this order are found. And these facts more than
any other, would indicate that the special adaptation of animals
to particular districts of the surface of our globe is
neither accidental, nor dependent upon physical conditions,
but is implied in the primitive plan of the creation itself.
Whatever classes we may take into consideration, we shall
find similar adaptations, and though, perhaps, the greater
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>uniformity of some families renders the difference of the
types in various parts of the world less striking, they are
none the less real. The <i>Carnivora</i> of tropical Asia are not
the same as those of tropical Africa, or those of tropical
America. Their birds and reptiles present similar differences.
The want of an ostrich in Asia, when we have one,
the largest of the family, in Africa, and two distinct species in
Southern America, and two cassowaries, one in New Holland,
and another in the Sunda Islands, shews this constant
process of analogous or representative species repeated over
different parts of the world to be the principle regulating the
distribution of animals, and the fact that these analogous
species are different, again, cannot be reconciled to the idea
of a common origin, as each type is peculiar to the country
where it is now found. These differences are more striking
in tropical regions than anywhere else. The rhinoceros of
the Sunda Islands differs from those of Africa, and there is
none in America. The elephant of Asia differs from that of
Africa, and there is none in America. One tapir is found in
the Sunda Islands, there is none in Africa, but we find
one in South America, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Everywhere special adaptation,
particular forms in each continent, an omission of some allied
type here, when in the next group it occurs all over the zone.</p>

<p>As we ascend into the temperate zone, we find, however,
the similarity greatly increased. The difference between the
species of the same family in temperate Asia, temperate
Europe, and temperate America is much less than between
the corresponding animals of the tropical zone, and no doubt
it is to this great assemblage of more uniform animals, living
originally within the main seat of human civilization, that we
must ascribe the idea of their common origin, which has so
long prevailed and been so serious an obstacle to a real insight
into these natural phenomena. What, indeed, could be
more natural for man, when for the first time reflecting upon
nature around him,&mdash;when seeing, as far as he could extend
his investigations, all things alike,&mdash;than to imagine that every
thing arose from a common centre, and spread with him over
the world, as it has been the fate of the white race, and of
that only, to extend all over the globe, and that, influenced
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>by the phenomena of the zone in which he lived and wandered,
and from which he extended farther, he took it for granted
that all animals followed the same laws. But now that
we know the whole surface of our globe so satisfactorily, there
can no longer be a question about the difference between
animals and plants in the lower latitudes in all continents.
Besides, we see them equally striking in the southernmost
extremities of the three great continents, so that there can no
longer be any doubt about the primitive adaptation of these
various types to the continents where they live, as we do not
find a single one naturally diffused everywhere over all continents.
Notwithstanding, therefore, the slighter differences
we notice between the animals of different continents in the
temperate zone, we are thus led step by step to ascribe to
them also a special origin upon those continents where they
now occur.</p>

<p>But as soon as we rise to the highest latitudes, the uniformity
becomes so close, that there is no longer any marked
difference noticed between the animals about the arctic regions,
either in America, Europe, or Asia; and we are naturally
led to restrict the idea of a common centre of origin, or at
least of a narrow circle of primitive development, to those
animals which spread equally over the icy fields extending
around the northern pole upon the three continents which
meet in the north. The phenomena of geographical distribution
which we observe there among the terrestrial animals
are repeated in the same manner among the aquatic ones.
The fishes in the arctic seas do not materially differ on the
shores of Europe, Asia, and America, and through the northern
Atlantic and through Behring's Straits they extend more
or less towards the colder temperate zone, or migrate into it
at particular seasons of the year, as do most birds of the
arctic regions also. But in the temperate zone we begin to
find more and more marked differences between the inhabitants
of different continents, and even between those of the
opposite shores of the same ocean; as, for instance, the fishes
of Europe (some of the northern species excepted) are not
identical with those of the temperate shores of North America,
notwithstanding the very open field left for their uniform distribution
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>across the Atlantic. Such is also the case between
the fishes of Western Africa and those of Central America,
and between those of the southern extremities of these continents.
The fishes of the Indian Ocean, and the fishes of the
Pacific vary greatly, and, though some families have a wider
range, there are many which are circumscribed within the
narrowest limits. It is one of the most striking phenomena<a name= "fnanchor_N4" id= "fnanchor_N4"></a><a href= "#footnote_N4" class= "fnanchor">[N4]</a>
in the geographical distribution of aquatic animals, to find
entire families of fishes completely circumscribed within particular
groups of islands, such, for instance, as the <i>Labyrinthici</i>,
which are peculiar to the Sunda Islands, and the
family of <i>Goniodonts</i>, which are found only in the rivers of
South America.</p>

<p>A similar narrow limitation occurs also among the terrestrial
animals, as the family of <i>Colubris</i> is entirely circumscribed
within the boundaries of the warmer parts of the
American continent. The appearance during the warmer
season of the year of a few species of that family in the
Northern States, does not make this case less strong. Examples
might be multiplied without end to shew everywhere
special adaptation, narrow circumscription, or representative
adaptation of species in different parts of the world; but
those mentioned will be sufficient to sustain the argument
that animals are naturally antochthones wherever they are
found, and have been so at all geological periods; that in
northern regions they are most uniform; that their diversity
goes on increasing through the temperate zone till it reaches
its maximum in the tropics; that this diversity is again reduced
in the aquatic<a name= "fnanchor_N5" id= "fnanchor_N5"></a><a href= "#footnote_N5" class= "fnanchor">[N5]</a> animals towards the antarctic pole,
though the physical difference between the southernmost extremities
of America, Africa, and New Holland, seems to
have called for an increased difference between their terrestrial
animals.</p>

<p>We are thus led to distinguish special provinces in the
natural distribution of animals, and we may adopt the following
division as the most natural: <em>First</em>, the <em>arctic province</em>,
with prevailing uniformity. <em>Second</em>, the temperate zone, with
at least three distinct zoological provinces&mdash;the <em>European
temperate zone</em>, west of the Ural Mountains, the <em>Asiatic temperate
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>zone</em> east of the Ural Mountains, and the <em>American
temperate zone</em>, which may be subdivided into two, the <em>eastern</em>
and the <em>western</em>&mdash;for the animals east and west of the Rocky
Mountains differ sufficiently to constitute two distinct zoological
provinces. Next, the tropical zone, containing the
<em>African zoological province</em>, which extends over the main part
of the African continent, including all the country south of
the Atlas and north of the Cape Colonies; the <em>tropical
Asiatic province</em>, south of the great Himalayan chain, and
including the Sunda Islands, whose <i>Fauna</i> has quite a continental
character, and differs entirely from that of the
Islands of the Pacific, as well as from that of New Holland;
the <em>American tropical province</em>, including Central America,
the West Indies, and tropical South America. <em>New Holland</em>
constitutes in itself a special province, notwithstanding the
great differences of its northern and southern climate, the
animals of the whole continent preserving throughout their
peculiar typical character. But it were a mistake to conceive
that the <i>Faunæ</i> or natural groups of animals are to be
limited according to the boundaries of the mainland. On the
contrary we may trace their natural limits into the ocean,
and refer to the temperate European <i>Fauna</i> the eastern shores
of the Atlantic, as we refer its western shores to the American
temperate <i>Fauna</i>. Again, the eastern shores of the
Pacific belong to the western American <i>Fauna</i>, as the western
Pacific shores belong to the Asiatic <i>Fauna</i>. In the Atlantic
Ocean there is no purely oceanic <i>Fauna</i> to be distinguished,
but in the <em>Pacific</em> we have such a <i>Fauna</i>, entirely marine
in its main character, though interspread with innumerable
islands extending east of the Sunda Islands and New Holland
to the western shores of tropical America. The islands west
of this continent seem, indeed, to have very slight relations
in their zoological character with the western parts of the
mainland. South of the tropical zone we have the <em>South
American temperate Fauna</em>, and that of the <em>Cape of Good
Hope</em>, as other distinct zoological provinces. Van Diemen's
Land, however, does not constitute a zoological province in
itself, but belongs to the province of New Holland, by its
zoological character. Finally, the antarctic circle encloses a
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>special zoological province, including the <em>antarctic Fauna</em>,
which, in a great measure, corresponds to the arctic <i>Fauna</i>
in its uniformity, though it differs from it in having chiefly a
maritime character, while the arctic <i>Fauna</i> has an almost
entirely continental aspect.</p>

<p>The fact that the principal races of man, in their natural
distribution, cover the same extent of ground as the great
zoological provinces, would go far to shew that the differences
which we notice between them are also primitive; but
for the present we shall abstain from further details upon
a subject involving so difficult problems as the question of
the unity or plurality of origin of the human family, satisfied
as we are to have shewn that animals, at least, did not originate
from a common centre, nor from single pairs, but
according to the laws which at present still regulate their
existence.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_1" id="footnote_1"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_1">[1]</a>
The following statements have been strictly considered, and are made in
reference to a revised classification of the animal kingdom, the details of which
must, however, be omitted here, as they would extend this article beyond our
allotted bounds.</p>

<h3 class="p4 break"><a name="Art_1-1"></a><cite>Additional Illustrations of the Geographical Distribution of
Animals.</cite></h3>

<h4>I.&mdash;<cite>Geographical Distribution of Sturgeons.</cite><a name= "fnanchor_2" id= "fnanchor_2"></a><a href= "#footnote_2" class= "fnanchor">[2]</a></h4>

<p class="smaller">The sturgeons are generally large fishes, which live at the bottom
of the water, feeding with their toothless mouths upon decomposed
organized substances. Their movements are rather sluggish, resembling
somewhat those of the cod-fish.</p>

<p class="smaller">Their geographical distribution is quite peculiar, and constitutes
one of their prominent peculiarities. Located as they are, in the
colder portions of the temperate zone, they inhabit either the fresh
waters or the seas exclusively, or alternately both these elements,&mdash;remaining
during the larger part of the year in the sea, and ascending
the rivers in the spawning season. Although adapted to the
cold regions of the temperate, they do not seem to extend into the
arctic zone, and I am not aware that they have been observed in
any of the waters of the warmer half of the temperate zone. The
great basin of salt-water lakes or seas which extends east of the
Mediterranean, seems to be their principal abode in the Old World, or
at least the region in which the greater number of species occur;
and each species takes a wide range, extending up the Danube and
its tributaries, and all the Russian rivers emptying into the Black
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>Sea. From the Caspian they ascend the Wolga in immense shoals,
and are found further east in the lakes of Central Asia, even as far
as the borders of China. The great Canadian lakes constitute
another centre of distribution of these fishes in the New World, but
here they are not so numerous, nor do they ever occur in contact
with salt water in this basin.</p>

<p class="smaller">Northwards, there is another great zone of distribution of sturgeons,
which inhabit all the great northern rivers emptying into the
Arctic Sea, in Asia as well as in America. They occur equally in
the intervening seas, being found on the shores of Norway and
Sweden, in the Baltic and North Seas, as well as in the Atlantic
Ocean, from which they ascend the northern rivers of Germany, as
well as those of Holland, France, and Great Britain. Even the
Mediterranean and the Adriatic have their sturgeons, though few in
number. There are also some on the Atlantic shores of North
America, along the British possessions as well as the northern and
middle United States. They seem to be exceedingly numerous in
the Northern Pacific, being found everywhere from Behring's
Straits and Japan to the northern shores of China, and on the north-west
coast of America, as far south as the Columbia River. Again,
the so-called western waters of the United States have their own
species, from the Ohio down to the lower portion of the Mississippi,
but it does not appear that these species ascend the rivers from the
Gulf of Mexico. I suppose them to be rather entirely fluviatile, like
those of the great Canadian lakes.</p>

<p class="smaller">Beyond the above limits southwards there are nowhere sturgeons
to be found, not even in the Nile, though emptying into a sea in
which they occur; and as for the great rivers of Southern Asia and
of tropical Africa, not only the sturgeons, but another family is wanting
there,&mdash;I mean the family of <i>Goniodonts</i>, which in Central and
Southern America takes the place of the sturgeons of the north.
Again, all the species in different parts of the world are different.</p>

<p class="smaller">It is a most extraordinary fact, which will hereafter throw much
light upon the laws of geographical distribution of animals and their
mode of association, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, that certain families are entirely circumscribed
within comparatively narrow limits, and that their special
location has an unquestionable reference to the location of other
animals; or, in other words, that natural families, apparently little
related to each other, are confined to different parts of the world,
but are linked together by some intermediate form, which itself is
located in the intermediate track between the two extremes. In the
case now before us, we have the sturgeons extending all around the
world in the northern temperate hemisphere, in its seas as well as in
its fresh waters, all closely related to each other. Neither in Asia
nor in Africa is there an aberrant form of that type, or any representative
type in the warmer zones; but in North America we have
the genus <i>Scaphirhynhus</i>, which occurs in the Ohio and Mississippi,
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>and which forms a most natural link with the family of <i>Goniodonts</i>,
all the species of which are confined exclusively to the fresh waters of
Central and South America. The closeness of this connection will
be at once perceived by attempting to compare the species of true
<i>Sonicariæ</i> with the <i>Scaphirhynhus</i>. I know very well, that the
affinities of <i>Goniodonts</i> and <i>Siluroids</i> with sturgeons are denied, but
I still strongly insist upon their close relationship, which I hope to
establish satisfactorily in a special paper, as I continued to insist
upon the relation between sturgeons and gar-pikes, at one time positively
contradicted and even ridiculed. I trust then to be able to
shew, that the remarkable form of the brains of <i>Siluridæ</i> comes
nearer to that of sturgeons and <i>Lepidostei</i> than to that of any other
family of fishes. This being the case, it is obvious that there must
be in the physical condition of the continent of America some inducement
not yet understood, for adaptations so special and so different
from what we observe in the Old World. Indeed, such
analogies between the organized beings almost from one pole to
another, occur from man down to the plants in America only, among
its native products; while, in the Old World, plants as well as animals
have more circumscribed homes, and more closely characterized
features, in the various continents, at different latitudes.</p>

<p class="smaller">As for the species of sturgeons which occur in the Canadian lakes,
I know only three from personal examination, one of which was
obtained in Lake Superior, at Michipicotin, another at the Pic, and
the third at the Sault; though I know that they occur in all other
Canadian lakes, yet it remains to be ascertained how the species said
to be so common in Lake Huron, compared with those of Lake
Superior, and with those in the other great lakes and the St Lawrence
itself. As for the Atlantic species, ascending the rivers of the
United States west and south of Cape Cod, I know them to differ
from those of the lakes, at least from those which I possess from
Lake Superior. The number of species of this interesting family
which occur in the United States is, at all events, far greater than
would be supposed from an examination of the published records.
Upon close comparison of the specimens<a name= "fnanchor_N6" id= "fnanchor_N6"></a><a href= "#footnote_N6" class= "fnanchor">[N6]</a> in my collection from different
parts of the country, and in different museums, as those of the
Natural History Society of Boston, of Salem, of the Lyceum of New
York, my assistant, Mr Charles Giran, and myself, have discovered
several species not described. For this comparison I was the better
prepared, as I had an opportunity in former years of studying almost
all the European species in a fresh condition, during a prolonged visit
in Vienna.</p>

<h4><a name="Art_1-2"></a>II.&mdash;<i>Fishes of Lake Superior compared with those of the other
great Canadian Lakes.</i></h4>

<p class="smaller">Besides the interest there is everywhere in studying the living
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>animals of a new country, there is a particular interest to a naturalist
in ascertaining their peculiar geographical distribution, and their
true affinities with those of other countries. It is only by following
such a course, that we can hope to arrive at any exact results as to
their origin. In this respect the fresh-water animals have a peculiar
interest, as from the element they inhabit, they are placed under
exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p class="smaller">Marine animals, as well as those inhabiting dry land, seem to
have a boundless opportunity before them to spread over large parts
of the earth's surface, and their locomotive powers would generally
be sufficient to carry them almost anywhere; but they do not avail
themselves of the possibility; notwithstanding their facilities for locomotion,
they for the most part remain within very narrow limits,
using their liberty rather to keep within certain definite bounds. This
tendency of the higher animals especially, to keep within well-ascertained
limits, is perhaps the strongest evidence that there is a natural
connection between the external world and the organised beings
living upon the present surface of our globe. The laws which regulate
these relations, and those of geographical distribution in particular,
have already been ascertained to a certain extent, and will
receive additional evidence from the facts recorded during our
journey.</p>

<p class="smaller">The fresh-water animals are placed in somewhat different circumstances.
Their abode being circumscribed by dry land, within limits
which are often reduced to a narrow current of water, and being
further, for the most part, prevented by structural peculiarities from
passing from the rivers into the ocean, they are confined within
narrower limits than either terrestrial or marine types. Within
these limits again they are still further restricted; the shells and
fishes of the head waters of large rivers, for instance, being scarcely
ever the same as those of their middle or lower course, few species
extending all over any fresh-water basin from one extreme of its
boundary to the other; thus forming at various heights above the
level of the sea, isolated groups of fresh-water animals in the midst
of those which inhabit the dry land. These groups are very similar
in their circumscription to the islands and coral reefs of the ocean;
like them, they are either large or small, isolated and far apart, or
close together in various modes of association. In every respect
they form upon the continents, as it were, a counterpart of the
Archipelagos.</p>

<p class="smaller">From their circumscription, these groups of lakes present at once a
peculiar feature in the animal kingdom, their inhabitants being entirely
unconnected with any of the other living beings which swarm
around them. What, for instance, is there apparently in common
between the fishes of our lakes and rivers, and the quadrupeds which
inhabit their shores, or the birds perching on the branches which
overshadow their waters? Or what connection is there between the
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>few hermit-like terrestrial animals that live upon the low islands of
the Pacific and the fishes which play among the corals, or in the
sand and mud of their shores? And nevertheless there is but one
plan in the creation; fresh-water animals under similar latitudes
are as uniform as the corresponding vegetation, and however isolated
and apparently unconnected the tropical islands may seem, their inhabitants
agree in their most important traits.</p>

<p class="smaller">The best evidence that in the plan of creation animals are intended
to be located within circumscribed boundaries, is further derived
from their regular migrations. Although the arctic birds wander
during winter into temperate countries, and some reach even the
warmer zones; although there are many which, from the colder temperate
climates, extend quite into the tropics, there is nevertheless
not one of these species which passes from the northern to the
southern hemispheres; not one which does not return at regular
epochs to the countries whence it came from. And the more minutely
we trace this geographical distribution, the more we are impressed
with the conviction that it must be primitive; that is to say, that
animals must have originated where they live, and have remained
almost precisely within the same limits ever since they were created,
except in a few cases, where, under the influence of man, those limits
have been extended over large areas. To express this view still more
distinctly, I should say the question to be settled is, whether for instance
the wild animals which live in America originated in this
continent, or migrated into it from other parts of the world; whether
the black bear was created in the forests of New England and the
northern states, or whether it is derived from some European bear,
which by some means found its way to this continent, and being
under the influence of a new climate, produced a new race; whether
the many peculiar birds of North America which live in forests
composed of trees different from those which occur either in Europe
or Asia, whether these birds, which themselves are not identical with
those of any other country, were or were not created where they
live; whether the snapping turtle, the alligator, the rattlesnake,
and other reptiles which are found only in America, have become
extinct in the Old World after migrating over the Atlantic, to be
preserved in this continent; whether the fishes of the great Canadian
lakes made their appearance first in those waters, or migrated
thither from somewhere else? These are questions which such an
inquiry into the geographical distribution of animals involves; it is
the great question of the unity or plurality of creations; it is not
less the question of the origin of animals from single pairs or in
large numbers; and, strange to say, a thorough examination of the
fishes of Lake Superior, compared with those of the adjacent waters,
is likely to throw more light upon such questions, than all traditions,
however ancient, however near in point of time to the epoch of creation
itself.</p>

<p class="smaller">In order to proceed methodically in this investigation, our first
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>step must be to examine minutely, whether the fishes of Lake Superior
are the same as those of other lakes, in this or any other
country; and, if not, how they differ. To satisfy ourselves in this
respect, we shall successively examine all the families of fishes,
which have representatives in those great fresh-water seas. (<cite>Agassiz
on Lake Superior</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 246.) Professor Agassiz, after admirable
histories of the fishes of Lake Superior, concludes with the following
excellent observations:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span><a name= "fnanchor_3" id= "fnanchor_3"></a><a href= "#footnote_3" class= "fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h4><a name="Art_1-3"></a>III.&mdash;<cite>General Observations; all Fresh-water Fishes of North America
different from those of Europe&mdash;Lake Superior and the
Lakes north of it constitute a distinct Zoological District&mdash;These
Fishes have been created where they now live&mdash;Deductions
from this fact.</cite></h4>

<p class="smaller">Such a critical revision of the fishes of Lake Superior, and the
other great Canadian lakes, was the first necessary step in the investigation
I am tracing, in order to ascertain the natural primitive
relations between them and the region which they inhabit. Before
drawing the conclusions which follow directly from these facts, I
should introduce a similar list of the fishes living in similar latitudes,
or under similar circumstances, in other parts of the world; and more
particularly of the species of Northern Europe. But such a list, to
be of any use, should be throughout based upon a critical comparative
investigation of all the species of that continent, which would
lead to too great a digression. The comparison of the fresh-water
fishes of Europe, which correspond to those of North America, has
been carried so far, that I feel justified in assuming, what is really
the fact, that all the species of North America, without a single exception,
differ from those of Europe, if we limit ourselves strictly to
fishes which are exclusively the inhabitants of fresh water.</p>

<p class="smaller">I am well aware that the salmon which runs up the rivers of
Northern and Central Europe, also occurs on the eastern shores of
the northern part of North America, and runs up the rivers emptying
into the Atlantic. But this fish is one of the marine arctic
fishes, which migrates with many others, annually further south, and
which migratory species is common to both continents. Those species,
however, which never leave the fresh waters, are, without exception,
different on the two continents. Again, on each of the
continents, they differ in various latitudes; some, however, taking
a wider range than others in their natural geographical distribution.</p>

<p class="smaller">The fresh-water fishes of North America, which form a part of its
temperate fauna, extend over very considerable ground; for there is
no reason to subdivide into distinct faunæ the extensive tracts of
lands between the arctics and the Middle States of the Union. We
notice over these, considerable uniformity in the character of the fresh-water
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>fishes. Nevertheless, a minute investigation of all their species
has shewn that Lake Superior proper, and the fresh waters
north of it, constitute in many respects a special zoological district,
sufficiently different from that of the lower lakes and the northern
United States, to form a natural division in the great fauna of the
fresh-water fishes of the temperate zone of this continent.</p>

<p class="smaller">We have shewn that there are types, occurring in all the lower
lakes, which never occur in Lake Superior and northwards, and that
most of the species found in Lake Superior are peculiar to it; the
Salmonidæ only taking a wider range, and some of them covering
almost the whole extent of that fauna, while others appear circumscribed
within very narrow limits.</p>

<p class="smaller">Now, such differences in the range which the isolated species take
in the faunæ, is a universal character of the distribution of animals;
some species of certain families covering, without distinction, extensive
grounds, which are occupied by several species of other families,
limited to particular districts of the same zone.</p>

<p class="smaller">But after making due allowance for such variations, and taking a
general view of the subject, we arrive, nevertheless, at this conclusion;
that all the fresh-water fishes of the district under examination
are peculiar to that district, and occur nowhere else in any other
part of the world.</p>

<p class="smaller">They have their analogues in other continents, but nowhere beyond
the limits of the American continent do we find any fishes identical
with those of the district, the fauna of which we have been recently
surveying. The lamprey eels of the lake district have very
close representatives in Europe, but they cannot be identified. The
sturgeons of this continent are neither identical with those of Europe
nor with those of Asia. The cat-fishes are equally different. We
find a similar analogy and similar differences between the perches,
pickerels, eelpouts, salmons, and carps. In all the families which
occur throughout the temperate zone, there are near relatives on the
two continents, but they do not belong to the same stock. And in
addition to these, there are also types which are either entirely peculiar
to the American continent, such as Lepidosteus and Percopsis,
or belong to genera which have not simultaneous representatives in
the two worlds, and are therefore more or less remote from those
which have such close analogues. The family of Percoids, for instance,
has several genera in Europe, which have no representatives
in America; and several genera in America which have no representatives
in Europe, besides genera which are represented on both continents,
though by representatives specifically distinct.</p>

<p class="smaller">Such facts have an important bearing upon the history of creation;
and it would be very unphilosophical to adhere to any view
respecting its plan, which would not embrace these facts, and grant
them their full meaning. If we face the fundamental question which
is at the bottom of this particular distribution of animals, and ask
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>ourselves, where have all these fishes been created, there can be but
one answer given which will not be in conflict and direct contradiction
with the facts themselves, and the laws that regulate animal
life. The fishes, and all other fresh-water animals of the region of
the great lakes, must have been created where they live. They are
circumscribed within boundaries over which they cannot pass, and to
which there is no natural access from other quarters. There is no
trace of their having extended further in their geographical distribution
at any former period, nor of their having been limited within
narrower boundaries.</p>

<p class="smaller">It cannot be rational to suppose that they were created in some
other part of the world, and were transferred to this continent, to
die away in the region where they are supposed to have originated,
and to multiply in the region where they are found. There is no
reason why we should not take the present evidence in their distribution
as the natural fact respecting their origin, and that they are,
and were from the beginning, best suited for the country where they
are now found.</p>

<p class="smaller">Moreover, they bear to the species which inhabit similar regions,
and live under similar circumstances in Europe and Asia, and the
Pacific side of this continent, such relations, that they appear to the
philosophical observer as belonging to a plan which has been carried
out in its details with reference to the general arrangement. The
species of Europe, Asia, and the Pacific side of this continent, correspond
in their general combination to the species of the eastern
and northern parts of the American continent, all over which the
same general types are extended. They correspond to each other on
the whole, but differ as to species.</p>

<p class="smaller">And again, this temperate fauna has such reference to the fauna
of the arctic, and to that of the warmer zones, that any transposition
of isolated members of the whole plan would disturb the
harmony which is evidently maintained throughout the natural distribution
of organized beings all over the world. This internal
evidence of an intentional arrangement, having direct reference to
the present geographical distribution of the animals, dispersed over
the whole surface of our globe, shews most conclusively, that they
have been created where they are now found. Denying this position
were equivalent to denying that the creation has been made
according to a wise plan. It were denying to the Creator the intention
of establishing well-regulated natural relations between the beings
he has called into existence. It were denying him the wisdom which
is exemplified in nature, to ascribe it to the creatures themselves,&mdash;to
ascribe it even to those creatures in which we hardly see evidence
of consciousness, or, worse than all, to ascribe this wonderful order to
physical influence or mere chance.</p>

<p class="smaller">As soon as this general conclusion is granted, there are, however,
some further adaptations which follow as a matter of course. Each
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>type, being created within the limits of the natural area which it is
to inhabit, must have been placed there under circumstances favourable
to its preservation and reproduction, and adapted to the fulfilment
of the purposes for which it was created. There are in animals
peculiar adaptations which are characteristic of their species, and
which cannot be supposed to have arisen from subordinate influences.
Those which live in shoals cannot be supposed to have been created
in single pairs. Those which are made to be the food of others cannot
have been created in the same proportions as those which feed
upon them. Those which are everywhere found in innumerable specimens,
must have been introduced in numbers capable of maintaining
their normal proportions to those which live isolated, and are
comparatively and constantly fewer. For we know that this harmony
in the numerical proportions between animals is one of the great
laws of nature. The circumstance that species occur within definite
limits where no obstacles prevent their wider distribution, leads to
the further inference that these limits were assigned to them from
the beginning and so we would come to the final conclusion, that
the order which prevails throughout the creation is intentional,&mdash;that
it is regulated by the limits marked out on the first day of creation,&mdash;and
that it has been maintained unchanged through ages, with
no other modifications than those which the higher intellectual powers
of man enable him to impose upon some of the few animals more
closely connected with him, and in reference to those very limited
changes which he is able to produce artificially upon the surface of
our globe.<a name= "fnanchor_4" id= "fnanchor_4"></a><a href= "#footnote_4" class= "fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p class="p2">This town is named in Scripture Elath or Eloth; in the
Septuagint Αἰλὰθ, and Αἰλὼν; Αἰλὰς, Ἀειλὰ, or Aila by the
Greeks; Ælana by the Romans; and Ailah by the Arabians:
it is described in 1 Kings <abbr title="nine">ix.</abbr> 26, as <q>on the <em>shore</em> of the <em>Red
Sea</em> in the land of Edom;</q> and in 2 <abbr title="Chronicles 8">Chron. viii.</abbr> 17, <q>at the
<em>sea-side</em> in the land of Idumea.</q> From Procopius, in the 6th
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>century, we learn the following exact account,<a name= "fnanchor_5" id= "fnanchor_5"></a><a href= "#footnote_5" class= "fnanchor">[5]</a> which agrees
very well with the site of those <em>mounds</em>&mdash;<q>the eastern limits
of <i>Palæstina</i> (including of course that part of the peninsula
which he elsewhere relates<a name= "fnanchor_6" id= "fnanchor_6"></a><a href= "#footnote_6" class= "fnanchor">[6]</a> was called <i>Palæstina Tertia</i>),
reach along the Red Sea. On the shore is placed the town
<i>Aïlas</i>, where, the sea ending, it is contracted into a very narrow
bay.</q></p>

<p>Edrisi, in the 12th century, terms the steep descent from
the Desert El Tyh by El Nakb to Akaba&mdash;<q>Akaba Ailah</q>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the <q>Descent of Ailah;</q> and Makrisi, in the 14th century,
as cited by Burckhardt (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 511), speaks of <q>the <i>Akaba</i>,
or steep mountain <em>before Aila</em>.</q> Consequently, I take it to
be correct that these <em>mounds</em> indicate the former position of
<i>Elath</i>,<a name= "fnanchor_7" id= "fnanchor_7"></a><a href= "#footnote_7" class= "fnanchor">[7]</a> on the shore of the Sea of Edom or Idumea&mdash;an arm
of the Red Sea.</p>

<p>At a short distance from them, but westward, a large space,
like a marsh, seemed to be impregnated with <em>nitre</em>, which is
left incrusted in some spots upon their surface. From hence,
going up the extensive valley El Araba, it is found to be full
of sand drifts, with here and there a few trees scattered
about; the torrents, after rain, flow along the west side, and
their waters, which are <em>not absorbed</em> by the <em>sand</em>, enter the
sea at the north-west angle. The width of this part of the
Wadi is near 5 miles, but in advancing farther to the north
it becomes wider. The mountains on the east are high&mdash;from
2000 to 2500 feet; being of <em>granitic</em>, or rather <em>porphyritic</em>
formation, they are highly picturesque, and have fine, lofty,
jagged peaks: but those on the west, which are <em>sandstone</em> and
<em>chalk</em>, are lower; rising to about a level with the desert El Tyh,
they do not exceed 1500, or in places 1800 feet in elevation.</p>

<p><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>Not far from Wadi Ghadyan,<a name= "fnanchor_8" id= "fnanchor_8"></a><a href= "#footnote_8" class= "fnanchor">[8]</a> towards the west side, a
great marsh-like tract, apparently impregnated with <em>nitre</em>,
exhibits an incrustation on its surface. And the water in
the spring itself is, according to <i>M. De Bertou</i>, strong of
<em>sulphur</em>.</p>

<p>Passing the opening of Wadi Beianeh, and still ascending,
the most elevated table-land or small plateau of the Wadi-El-Araba
is reached at about the line of 30° north latitude,
and 35° 15' east longitude nearly, which is very near 500 feet
higher than the level of the Gulf of Akaba, according to <i>Herr
Schubert</i>. About that point the <em>water-shed</em> occurs; some of
the waters of the Araba flow south into the sea of Akaba, but
most are carried off north by the tributaries of the Wadi-el-Jeib
into the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>The same traveller (<i>Schubert</i>) found the depression of the
bed of that deep Wadi at about 4 miles south of El Weibeh
(<q>hole with water,</q>) to be 91 Paris feet, or 97 English feet
<em>below</em> the level of the Red Sea; the commencement, or most
southern limit of that depression taking place at about 15
miles northward of Gebel Harun in Wadi-el-Araba. Consequently,
the Dead Sea, Asphaltic Lake (<i>Bahr Lut</i>)&mdash;the
<q>Sea of Lot</q>&mdash;must lie considerably <em>lower</em> than the level of
the Gulf of Akaba; indeed, <i>Herr Schubert</i> gives the level of
the <i>Dead Sea</i> as being 598 Paris feet, and M. Russegger
even more than 1300 English feet <em>below</em> that of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>These geographical facts then afford, as some authors have
supposed, sufficient evidence that the River Jordan, although
taking its source at an elevation of 1800 feet in the north
Syrian mountains&mdash;<em>has not</em> flowed through the entire valley
<i>El Araba</i> into the Gulf of Akaba; or rather, into the Red Sea,
beyond what is now the Strait of Tiran. And certainly these
facts are <em>decisive</em> that it <em>never has done so</em>&mdash;if the natural
conformation of this region has <em>always</em> been the <em>same</em>, as it
now exists with regard to <em>depth</em> and <em>height</em>. But against its
having continued the <em>same</em>, <i lang="la">ab initio</i>, up to the present time,
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>much reasonable hypothesis, and several remarkable appearances
may be fairly advanced.</p>

<p>Of the latter, some are the <em>volcanic</em> phenomena apparent
around the Dead Sea and El Ghor,<a name= "fnanchor_9" id= "fnanchor_9"></a><a href= "#footnote_9" class= "fnanchor">[9]</a> on the north; in the
basaltic cliffs and creeks nearly opposite the Isle of Kureiyeh;
the frequent displacements of strata and rocks in many places
on the north-west side of the Gulf of Akaba; the coincidences
exhibited by the strata in the Isle of Tiran, with those of the
Arabian and Sinaic shores; and the volcanic remains and
crater-like hills between them and Sherm on the south.
Moreover, it may be collected from Scripture, that certain
<em>changes</em> had actually been <em>effected</em> in the vicinity of the <i>Dead
Sea</i> (<abbr title="Genesis 19">Gen. xix.</abbr> 25); and that they were caused by <em>fire</em> (<i>Ibid.</i>
<abbr title="24">xxiv.</abbr> 28); if then, at that period, the southern part of the
valley of the Jordan, the plain of the Dead Sea, and El Ghor
had, through igneous, or volcanic, or other agency, <em>sunk</em> much
<em>below</em> their former levels, it is possible that a corresponding
<em>elevation</em> of the land in <i>Wadi-el-Araba</i> might have taken place
at the same (or perhaps at another) time, by the same (or by
a subsequent similar) agency.</p>

<p>Again, it seems probable from Scripture, that the <i>Dead
Sea</i> and <i>Wadi-el-Araba</i> had been once continued, or more
connected in their levels; because in Joshua <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 16, and <abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr> 3,
the former is called <q>the <em>sea of the plain</em> (even) the Salt Sea;</q>
and in <abbr title="Deuteronomy 4">Deut. iv.</abbr> 49, only <q>the <em>sea of the plain</em>;</q> the original
Hebrew expression in all three verses is, <q>Yam ha Arabah;</q>
that is, the <i>Sea of the Araba</i>; and the Septuagint renders it
ἡ θάλασσα Ἄραβα. <q>Ha Arabah,</q> in Hebrew, signifies the
same as <i>El Arabah</i> in Arabic&mdash;a <q>desert-plain,</q> or a <q>plain.</q>
So, likewise, we find in <abbr title="Deuteronomy 2">Deut. ii.</abbr> 8, <q>the children of Edom</q>
described as dwelling <q>in Seir, through the way of the <i>Plain</i>
from Elath, and from Eziongaber;</q> the Hebrew and Greek
words for <em>the plain</em> are here also the same, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, <q><i>Arabah</i>.</q>
Consequently, these passages from Scripture, shewing that
<em>both extremes</em>, north and south, of this great <em>plain</em> or <i>Wadi</i>,
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>bore the <em>same</em> appellation, prove that it was esteemed one
<em>entire</em> valley in its <em>whole extent</em>, from the Dead, or Salt Sea,
to Elath and Eziongaber on the Red Sea, or Ælanitic Gulf,
in the land of Edom (1 Kings <abbr title="nine">ix.</abbr> 26, and 2 <abbr title="Chronicles 8">Chron. viii.</abbr> 17.)
And, indeed, according to Dr Robertson, <em>no</em> such <em>division</em> of
it, as <i>M. De Bertou</i> and some other travellers assert, into
<i>Wadi-el-Akaba</i>, and <i>Wadi-el-Araba</i>,<a name= "fnanchor_10" id= "fnanchor_10"></a><a href= "#footnote_10" class= "fnanchor">[10]</a> at this day exists.</p>

<p>After having attained the highest point, or short table-land
of the Wadi-el-Araba, the descent in fact begins in a
direct line nearly due north to the Dead Sea; it is in places
more elevated, rougher, and more sandy than in others; and
its width also becomes greater. Gebel-el-Beianeh appears
the <em>loftiest</em> of the chain on the west; but this is scarcely
two-thirds as <em>high</em> as the east range, Gebel-el-Shera (<i>Mount
Seir</i>); the former is entirely sterile and arid, whilst the latter
is covered with herbs and occasional trees, and seems to
have a sufficiency of rain. The east <i>Wadis</i> also, which are
numerous, are filled with trees, shrubs, and flowers; and
their eastern and <em>higher</em> portions, being well cultivated, yield
good crops. So Strabo, calling the district <q>Nabathæa,</q>
states it <em>abounded in pastures</em>; ἡ Ναβαταία πολύανδρος οὖσα ἡ χώρα καὶ ἔυβοτος;<a name= "fnanchor_11" id= "fnanchor_11"></a><a href= "#footnote_11" class= "fnanchor">[11]</a> and being the country of Esau, it was <q>of the
fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above.</q>&mdash;<i><abbr title="Genesis">Gen.</abbr></i>
<abbr title="27">xxvii.</abbr> 39.</p>

<p>The range of Mount Seir, <i>Gebel-el-Shera</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the mountains
of a <q>region</q> or <q>tract,</q> under which I have only included
those mountains, commencing with Mount <i>Seir</i> itself
on the north, and extending to Gebel-el-Ithm on the
south. On the eastern side is now <em>sandstone</em>, veined with
<em>oxide of iron</em>; and those mountains still further to the east,
forming a part of the Nabathæan chain, are <em>limestone</em> with
<em>flints</em>, of the same <em>cretaceous</em> series as that of the Sinaic Peninsula;
they present many varied forms and shapes.</p>

<p>El Araba, in the approach to Wadi Gharandel, is more
covered with shifting sands, broken by innumerable undulations,
and low hills; into these sands the waters of Wadi
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>Gharandel, which, according to Burckhardt, have a <em>sulphureous</em>
taste, lose themselves. In the ascent of this Wadi
(Gharandel) towards Gebel Kula, a mountain is climbed
which is composed of <em>calcareous</em> rocks, <em>sandstone</em> and <em>flints</em>,
lying over each other in horizontal layers. Gebel Kula is
covered on its summit, with a <em>chalky</em> surface. But in Wadi
Dalegheh the mountains are <em>calcareous</em>, with some <em>flints</em>, and
perfectly bare.</p>

<p>East of these valleys, and distant about six miles, are said
to be the vestiges of a Roman road, which probably led near
Usdaka&mdash;the <i>Szadeke</i> of Burckhardt&mdash;to Petra. Near that
place is a hill with some considerable ruins, very possibly
the remains of what the Peutingerian Table calls <i>Zadagasta</i>;
which word seems to have been corrupted into <i>Zadeka</i>, and
<i>Sudaka</i>, or <i>Usdaka</i>. A fine spring, or <i>Ain</i>, is there much
noted. Also, further north five or six miles, at Ain Mefrak,
some ruins are visible. And the same traveller noticed, a
few miles north of the present picturesque village of Eljy&mdash;situate
a little east of Petra, in a more fertile spot&mdash;the substructions
of walls and paved roads, all constructed of flints.
The present road, traversed by the <i>Hadj</i>, or pilgrims, from
Syria to Mecca, passes about five miles more eastwards,
through Maan (<i>Maon</i>, Judges <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr> 12), placed in a rocky district.
This town is divided by two hills, on each of which
stands a portion of it. The fruits, especially pomegranates,
peaches, apricots, and grapes, are there excellent, and are
much sought after by the Syrian pilgrims. Burckhardt (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
436), says here, <q>are several <em>springs</em>, to which the town owes
its <em>origin</em>;</q> and I presume the word itself, Ma'an, is abbreviated
by use from <i>Mayan</i>, signifying a <q>fountain.</q></p>

<p><em>Fourthly.</em>&mdash;<q>Petra,</q> the Greek appellation of the capital
of the ancient <i>Nabathæa</i>, or territory of the Nabathæi, and
the <i>Edom</i> of Scripture, was called in Hebrew, <i>Sela</i>; both
words meaning a <q>rock,</q> and the first of which gave <em>its
name</em> to the country&mdash;<q>Arabia <i>Petræa</i>.</q> It is also called
<i>Joktheel</i>, in 2 Kings <abbr title="14">xiv.</abbr> 7. Strabo has distinctly recorded
that <q>Petra was the capital of the <em>Nabathæans who were
Idumæans</em>.</q> (<abbr title="Book 16">Lib. xvi.</abbr>) The former appellation having been
bestowed upon this people as descendants of <i>Nebaioth</i>,
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>(<abbr title="First Chronicles one">1 Chron. i.</abbr> 29), or <i>Nebajoth</i> (<abbr title="Genesis 25">Gen. xxv.</abbr> 13), who was Abraham
and Hagar's grandson, and Ishmael's first-born son.
Petra is correctly described by the same Greek geographer,
as well as by the Roman naturalist. The short account of
the last I here transcribe: <q lang="la">Nabatæi oppidum <em>includunt
Petram</em> nomine in <em>convalle</em>, paulo minus duum mill. passuum
amplitudinis, <em>circumdatum montibus</em> inaccessis <em>amne interfluente</em>.</q><a name= "fnanchor_12" id= "fnanchor_12"></a><a href= "#footnote_12" class= "fnanchor">[12]</a>
I will not add here any description of the very magnificent
remains of this remarkable city, the city of the <em>Rock</em>&mdash;or
rather excavated and carved out of the <em>natural rock</em>&mdash;whose
dwellings are said to have been <q>in the clefts of the
<em>rock</em>,</q> (Obadiah 3), since they are now so well known.</p>

<p>Coming to Petra from Eljy, on the east, the body of the
regular mountain on that side is limestone, and higher than
the red sandstone, where the tombs in Wadi Mousa are
excavated. The cliffs at Petra are of <em>red sandstone</em>, which is
soft and easily cut, causing the sculptures to decay quickly,
unless where they may have been <em>protected</em> from the weather.
This formation extends far to the north and south, and rests
on the lower masses of porphyry.</p>

<p>The colour of the <em>sandstone</em> rocks in Wadi Mousa is not a
dull monotonous <em>red</em>, but a variety of bright hues, <q>from the
deepest crimson,</q> as Dr Robinson writes (<abbr title="volume two">vol. ii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 531),
<q>to the softest pink; verging also sometimes to orange and
yellow. These varying shades are often distinctly marked by
waving lines, imparting to the surface of the rock a succession
of brilliant and changing tints, like the hues of watered
silk, and adding greatly to the imposing effect of the sculptured
monuments.</q></p>

<p>The site of Petra, in the high ravine, is called by the
Arabs, Wadi <i>Mousa</i>; most likely corrupted from <i>Moseroth</i>, or
<i>Mosera</i> (<abbr title="Deuteronomy 10">Deut. x.</abbr> 6), <q>where Aaron died and was buried.</q>
It is extremely interesting, and is well watered by a flowing
stream&mdash;the <i>El Syk</i> of Burckhardt. The <em>sandstone</em> rocks,
with their craggy and precipitous sides, have their summits
resembling rounded peaks; peaks, probably owing to the
softness of the stone, rounded by the effects of weather.
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>The height of this <i>Wadi</i> is estimated at near 2200 feet above
the adjoining Wadi-el-Araba. To the west of Petra, Mount
Hor, Gebel <i>Harun</i> constitutes the loftiest point of this <em>sandstone</em>
tract. It stands out conspicuously, and is a <em>cone</em> irregularly
truncated with three rugged peaks, of which that to
the <abbr title="northeast">NE.</abbr> is the <em>highest</em>, and has upon it the Mahommetan
<i>Wely</i>; or the tomb of <i>Aaron</i>, called <i>Neby Harun</i>. This peak
rises to about 2700 feet above Wadi <i>Mousa</i>, or to 5300 feet
above the sea.</p>

<p class="smaller">Captains Irby and Mangles, the <em>first</em> Europeans who ascended
Gebel <i>Harun</i>, thus describe <q>the view from the summit.</q> It <q>is
extremely extensive in every direction; but the eye rests on few
objects which it can clearly distinguish, and give a name to, although
an excellent idea is obtained of the general face and features of the
country. The chain of Idumean mountains, which form the western
shore of the Dead Sea, seem to run on to the south, though losing
considerably in their height. They appear in this point of view,
barren and desolate. Below them is spread out a white sandy plain,
seamed with the beds of occasional torrents, and presenting much
the same features as the most desert parts of the Ghor. Where this
desert expanse approaches the foot of Mount Hor, there arise out
of it, like islands, several lower peaks and ridges, of a purple colour,
probably composed of the same kind of <em>sandstone</em> as that of Mount
Hor itself, which, variegated as it is in its hues, presents in the distance
one uniform mass of dark purple. Towards the Egyptian side
there is an expanse of country without features or limit, and lost in
the distance. The lofty district which we had quitted in our descent
to Wadi Mousa, shuts up the prospect on the south-east side; but
there is no part of the landscape which the eye wanders over with
more curiosity and delight than the crags of Mount Hor itself, which
stand up on every side, in the most rugged and fantastic forms, sometimes
strangely piled one on the other, and sometimes as strangely
yawning in clefts of a frightful depth.</q></p>

<p>Under the term <i>Nabathæan Chain</i>, or the chain of the
mountains of Edom, I have restricted those mountains beginning
north of 30° <abbr title="north latitude">N. Lat.</abbr>, and which then tend round
northward, by the east of Petra. They are the loftiest on the
east, attaining probably to an altitude of 3000 feet above the
Wadi-el-Araba. This chain presents to the view, on the
east, long elevated ranges of <em>limestone</em>, sometimes with <em>flints</em>,
but of more easy slopes, <em>without</em> precipices, being smooth and
rounded. Further still to the east, the high plateau of the
Great Eastern Desert&mdash;of which <i>El Nejd</i> is a portion&mdash;stretches
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>out to an almost indefinite extent. To the west and
north, and around Mount <i>Hor</i>, lofty party-coloured <em>sandstone</em>
ridges and cliffs prevail; then succeed high masses of <em>porphyry</em>,
constituting the body of the mountains, but <em>lower</em> than
the <em>sandstone</em>. And, lastly, more northwards, the chain sinks
down into low hills of <em>argillaceous</em> rock, or of <em>limestone</em>.</p>

<p>The entire breadth of the <i>Seir</i> range seems not to exceed
eighteen English miles, between Wadi-el-Araba and the
Eastern Desert; whilst that of the more northern, or <i>Nabathæan
chain</i>, does not exceed twenty-two miles between
those districts.</p>

<p>Going west from Petra, the valley of the <i>Araba</i> is again
entered, where the deeper <i>Wadi-el-Jeib</i> is seen to wind along,
very near the middle of it, from the south, then sweeping off
<abbr title="northwest">NW.</abbr>, it meets the <i>Wadi-el-Jerafah</i>, which comes in from the
<abbr title="southwest">SW.</abbr> Afterwards, it is called only <i>Wadi-el-Jeib</i>; and being
a deep valley within a larger valley, it forms the chief water-course
of the greater portion of the Araba, and carries down
to the Dead Sea, in the wet season, an immense body of
water.</p>

<p>El Araba, more to the north of Gebel Harun, is much
wider; in parts of it there are <em>gravel</em> hills; and here and
there, masses of <em>porphyry</em> lie about in the sand, having been
washed down by the torrents. Eleven or twelve miles north
of that Mount (<i>Hor</i>), occurs the pass of <i>Nemela</i> among low
hills of <em>limestone</em>, or rather a yellowish <em>argillaceous</em> rock, the
dark steep mass of the mountain being <em>porphyry</em>, as before described;
thence the Wadi ascends between the porphyry and
limestone formations; and on the top is a little basin of
<em>yellow sandstone</em> capping the <em>porphyry</em>.</p>

<p>Coming back southward through the Wadi-el-Araba, as far
as the <em lang="fr">embouchure</em> of the valley of the <i>Jerafah</i>&mdash;meaning
<q>gullying,</q>&mdash;which is about a mile wide, the mountains on
this west side are found to be composed of <em>chalk</em> and <em>limestone</em>;
and, in many places, with large pieces of black <em>flint</em>.</p>

<p>On the north, and to the east of Lussan, the mountains of
Idumæa are lofty, consisting of precipitous <em>limestone</em> ranges;
the solitary conical mount, about 600 feet above the plain,
named <i>Gebel Araif-el-Naka</i>&mdash;<q>the crest of a she-camel,</q>
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>forms a conspicuous object; it is <em>calcareous</em>, and strewed with
<em>flints</em>. Low ridges extend from it westward and eastward;
the latter terminating in a headland or bluff, called Gebel
<i>Makrah</i>.</p>

<p>The wide sandy <i>Wadi-el-Ghudhagidh</i>&mdash;the <i>Ghudhaghidh</i> of
Robinson&mdash;is probably the <i>Gudgodah</i>; or, as it is written in
Hebrew, <i>Ghudghodah</i>, mentioned in <abbr title="Deuteronomy 10">Deut. x.</abbr> 7, whither the
Israelites journeyed from Mosera (<i>Wadi Mousa</i>) after Aaron's
death. After this valley were some low <em>chalky</em> cliffs, and
then succeeded a barren <em>flinty</em> tract.</p>

<p>Towards the <abbr title="northwest">NW.</abbr> and <abbr title="west">W.</abbr>, a broad open district stretches
out apparently to <i>Gebel Jaraf</i>, said to be 1300 feet above the
sea level, through which is the course of the <i>Wadi Khereir</i>,
elevated about 1000 feet at its nearest point to that mount,
and flowing northward into the large <i>Wadi-el-Agaba</i>,&mdash;upon
one side, and to <i>Gebel Yelak</i>, the <q>white mountain,</q> on the
other side; but it is broken in some places by <em>limestone</em> or
<em>chalk</em> hills.</p>

<p>The Wadi Ghudhagidh, and the more southern tributaries
of the Jerafah, flow to the <abbr title="northeast">NE.</abbr> to the Dead Sea, as already
explained; and they, with some smaller winter torrents that
unite with them, are the only water-courses in this part of
<i>Arabia Petræa</i> which supply that sea. On the <abbr title="southeast">SE.</abbr> of the
upper Jerafah, some low <em>limestone</em> ridges present themselves;
but, on the other side is the <em>sandy</em> plain <i>El Adhbeh</i>: beyond
this, northwards, follows a level plain covered with pebbles
and black <em>flints</em>. The high West Desert, called by the Arabs
El Tyh, the <q>wandering,</q> and so named in Edrisi and Abul-feda,
near its centre at <i>Nakhl</i>, signifying <q>date trees</q> (at
which station there exists a grove of those trees), at an
elevation of near 1500 feet above the sea, consists of vast
plains, or <em lang="fr">plateaux</em> of varying, mostly higher, altitudes, a
sandy, flinty, or gravelly soil, and limestone hills of the <em>cretaceous</em>
or secondary formation, having very irregular ridges
disposed in different directions.</p>

<p>The numerous <i>Wadis</i>, or water-courses, and winter torrents
of this enormous desert, all run to the <abbr title="north">N.</abbr> or <abbr title="northwest">NW.</abbr>, and
pour their waters into the Mediterranean Sea; while those
<i>Wadis</i> that lie on the other side of the Great Mountain range,
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>which bounds the desert in its western and southern
extremities&mdash;<i>Gebel-el-Rahah</i> and <i>Gebel-el-Tyh</i>&mdash;divide their waters,
and so supply, in part, the Gulf of <i>Suez</i>, and in part the
Gulf of <i>Akaba</i>. Of the former <i>Wadis</i>, two are the principal;
namely, <i>Wadi-el-Agaba</i>, which rises somewhat to the east of
the line of 34° <abbr title="east longitude">E. long.</abbr>; and <i>Wadi-el-Arish</i>, which Russegger
and later authors affirm as springing to the <em>west</em> of it, and
of <i>Gebels</i> Heiyalah, Yelak, and Mishea, and of which <i>Wadi
Nesil</i> seems to me to be only a tributary.</p>

<p>The chain called <i>Gebel-el-Egmeh</i>, or <i>El Odjme</i> by Burckhardt,
appears, as he says, <em>chalky</em>; and such, also, is the soil
of the plain, and frequently covered with <em>black</em> pebbles
(<em>flints</em>); it unites with the higher chain of the Gebel-el-Tyh,
about the centre of the Peninsula,&mdash;that is to say, of the
<i>Peninsular Triangle</i>, and where the branches North-el-Tyh
and South-el-Tyh separate. There the height of the summit
of <i>El Tyh</i> is given by Russegger as 4322 Paris feet, or
4615 English feet, above the sea; descending thence by the
pass of Mureikhi, into the sandy plain of <i>Debbet-el-Ramleh</i>,
the elevation of that plateau, just about the middle of it, and
about half way to the head of <i>Wadi-el-Sheikh</i>, is near 4000
feet above the sea level; Alahadar being a little to the east.</p>

<p>In the Wadi <i>El Sheikh</i>, meaning the <q>Valley of the Elder,</q>
or <q>Chief,</q> which is one of the principal valleys in the Peninsula,
before coming to <q>Moses' seat</q> (<i>Mokad Seidna Mousa</i>),
occurs a range of low hills of a substance called <i>Taffal</i>, chiefly
a detritus of the <em>felspar</em> of <em>granite</em>, like pipe clay. The easiest
approach to the present Sinaic district is by the east side of
this Wadi, which leads into the wider Wadi, or plain <i>El
Raha</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a <q>plain surrounded by hills.</q> The view of
Gebels <i>El Deir</i> (<q>The Convent</q>), the now-termed <i>Horeb</i>,
<i>Humer</i> (red), and others, from thence is very striking. The
lower granitic mountains of the present <i>Sinai</i> are more regularly
shaped than the upper; being less rugged, they have
<em>no</em> insulated <em>peaks</em>; and their summits terminate in smooth
<em>curves</em>. Whilst in the ascent to the higher mountains, <em>peaks
on peaks arise</em>, of the form of sharp cones, and of various
altitudes. <i>Gebel Mousa</i>, or <q>Moses' Mount,</q> is of <em>red granite</em>
for about half-way up; all the rest being a <em>yellowish granite</em>,
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>with small <em>black</em> grains, and from <i>Wadi Leja</i> (<q>asylum</q>),
these colours appear most distinct. The height of the apex
of G. <i>Mousa</i> peak, which does not exceed fifty yards in width,
was ascertained by Lieutenant Wellsted, from the <em>mean</em> of
observations, to be 7505 feet above the sea of Akaba; and
that late, able, and lamented officer, who was upon that summit
in <i>January</i>, and <q>enjoyed the advantage of a clear
serene atmosphere,</q> which, in a more advanced season of
the year, would have been hazy, with a blue mist, arising
from the powerful sun, <q>was thereby enabled, by means of
angles taken to the hills on the Arabian coast, ninety miles
distant, to correctly fix the geographical position of the
mountain.</q> He has also well described the most extensive
view from that peak, as follows:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><q>The Gulfs of Suez and Akaba are distinctly visible; from the
dark-blue waters of the latter, the island of <i>Tiran</i>, considered by the
ancient geographers as sacred to <i>Isis</i>,<a name= "fnanchor_13" id= "fnanchor_13"></a><a href= "#footnote_13" class= "fnanchor">[13]</a> rears itself. Mount Agrib
(<i>Garib</i>), on the other hand, points out 'the land of bondage.' Before
me is <abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> <i>Catherine</i>, its bare, conical peak now capped with snow.
In magnificence and striking effect, few parts of the world can surpass
the wild, naked scenery everywhere met with in the mountain-chain
which girds the sea-coast of Arabia.</q> ... The
monkish <q>Mount <i>Sinai</i> itself, and the hills which compose the district
in its immediate vicinity, rise in sharp, isolated, conical peaks.
From their steep and shattered sides huge masses have been splintered,
leaving fissures rather than valleys between their remaining
portions. These form the highest part of the range of mountains
that spread out over the Peninsula, and are very generally, in the
winter months, covered with snow, the melting of which occasions
the torrents which everywhere devastate the plains below. The peculiarities
of its <em>conical</em> formation, render this district yet more distinct
from the adjoining heights that appear in successive ridges beyond
it, while the valleys which intersect them are so narrow that
few can be perceived. No villages and castles, as in Europe, here
animate the picture; no forests, lakes, or falls of water, break the
silence and monotony of the scene. All has the appearance of a
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>vast and desolate wilderness, either grey, darkly-brown, or wholly
black.</q><a name= "fnanchor_14" id= "fnanchor_14"></a><a href= "#footnote_14" class= "fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>And Dr Lepsius remarks on this mountain, that<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><q>Although it is certainly a high mountain, still it is a <em>secondary</em> one,
and almost eclipsed by others of the Great Southern Chain, the
geographical centre of which is neither in <i>Gebel Mousa</i>, nor the
loftier <i>Gebel Katherin</i>, but in the more southern, and considerably
more elevated <i>Gebel-um-Schomar</i>.</q></p>

<p><i>Gebel Katherin</i>, composed principally of a coarse <em>red granite</em>,
presents the same <em>conical peaks</em>. But in Wadi <i>Owasz</i>, <abbr title="south">S.</abbr>
by <abbr title="west">W.</abbr>, from the last mountain, Burckhardt noticed <q>a
small chain of <em>white</em> and <em>red sandstone</em> hills in the midst of
<em>granite</em>.</q></p>

<p><i>Gebel-um-Schomar</i> (<q>Mount Mother <i>Schomar</i></q>), also consists
chiefly of <em>granite</em>; the lower part <em>red</em>, but the top is almost
<em>white</em>. In its middle, between the granite, occur broad
layers of brittle <em>black slate</em>, mixed with veins of <em>quartz</em> and
<em>felspar</em>, and with <em>micaceous schist</em>. Its extreme <em>peak</em>, about
8800 feet above the sea, is sharp pointed, and seems to be
inaccessible, owing to its perpendicular and smooth sides.
Burckhardt, in his attempt to ascend it, was obliged to halt
at about 200 feet below it. This was, until recently, esteemed
the <em>highest</em> point in the Peninsula; but, according to Herr
Russegger, two or three other peaks, to the south of it, are
about 500 feet more lofty; the <em>extreme</em> elevation of this last
group, which seems not to bear any distinct appellation, he
estimates at 9300 English feet.</p>

<p>I here add, after the latter author, a sketch of the <em>granite
peaks</em> of the high Modern-Sinaic mountains, from north to
south, as they present so interesting and remarkable an appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>In the narrow valley, a little south of <i>Gebel Mohala</i>, which
is all granite, on the east side of, or opposite to, the Schomar,
is a spring named <i>Tabakat</i>, where beautiful porphyry is observed.</p>

<p>The south side of Mount <i>Schomar</i> is very abrupt, and there
is <em>no</em> secondary chain between it and the other lofty southern
mountains, and the long gravelly plain <i>El Kaa</i>.</p>

<p>From that plain, entering <i>Wadi Hebron</i>&mdash;a ravine about
100 yards wide&mdash;fragments of rocks, principally of <em>granite</em> and
<em>porphyry</em> washed down by torrents, are frequent; a small
stream is seen flowing among them; in spots, some date trees
occur, and likewise the manna-producing tamarisk. Continuing
to ascend, a moderately-steep pass is reached; afterwards,
a descent of about 700 feet leads into the sandy <i>Wadi
Solaf</i> <q>wine valley;</q> and then, gaining, with some difficulty,
the summit of a steeper pass, the north-west angle of the
extensive <i>Wadi Raha</i> is come to. Here, again, the present
Sinaic group, beyond the plain, exhibits its rugged mountains
of dark <em>granite</em>, with <q>stern, naked, splintered <em>peaks</em>, and
ridges of indescribable grandeur.</q></p>

<p>Next, turning to the north down the narrow declivity
called <i>Nakb Hawi</i>, the <q>windy pass,</q> of which the stupendous
<em>granite</em> walls or cliffs elevate themselves to about 800
feet, passing to the west end of <i>Wadi Solaf</i>, where it meets
<i>Wadi Firan</i> and <i>Wadi-el-Sheikh</i>, and following the last valley
as far as <i>El Szaleib</i>, that ascent is attained. There the formation
consists of <em>granite</em>, on the upper beds of which run
layers of <em>red felspar</em>. North-east of <i>Wadi-el-Ush</i> is situate
<i>Gebel Sheyger</i>, which affords some native <em>cinnabar</em>. The
three principal passes leading from the sandy Debbet-el-Ramleh
on to the great desert over the Tyh range, are,
<i>El Mureikhi</i> near the centre and near <i>Gebel-el-Egmeh</i>; then
<i>El Warsah</i>, said to be of too rapid an ascent for caravans;
and the third, which is most to the west, <i>El Rakineh</i> (the
painted.) Afterwards, at some distance to the <abbr title="northwest">NW.</abbr>, is the
valley opening past <i>Ras Wadi Gharandel</i>, that has already
been described.</p>

<p>Proceeding, again, across the plain El Ramleh, and over
the pass Mureikhi on to the Desert-el-Tyh, in the approach
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>to the castle of <i>Nakhl</i>, on the east, a few miles off, low
<em>chalky</em> hills appeared; and in places there were holes wherein
<em>rock-salt</em> had been dug. The water at Nakhl is brackish,
and the ground chalky, covered with loose pebbles. <i>Wadi
Nesil</i> was observed to be overgrown with green shrubs.
<i>Gebel-el-Thughar</i>, signifying <q>the mouths,</q> presents a mountainous
tract, in which followed a valley with <em>calcareous</em> hills:
here deep sands were lodged, and large insulated rocks of a
porous <em>tufa</em>, called by Burckhardt <i lang="de">tufwacke</i>, lie scattered in
many places.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><q>The termination of the vast gravelly plain we had been crossing
from <i>Nakhl</i> was now at hand; but we could yet see it spreading
out wide to our left, the mirage giving its distant portions the appearance
of a succession of blue lakes; directly in front were the
mountains which close it in; and far to the right we could see,
stretching away, a still higher range running to the north, and on
the left the tops of the mountains about Wadi Gharandel, the <i>Taset</i>
(cup) <i>Soddur</i> being conspicuous afar. We entered these mountains
by a slight ascent, which struck soon after the head of a long winding
valley descending towards Suez: the immense plain we had
traversed, floated away in mist, and we had now done with the plateau
of the Great Desert.</q><a name= "fnanchor_15" id= "fnanchor_15"></a><a href= "#footnote_15" class= "fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Thence a plain, which is below the level of the Desert-el-Tyh,
and covered with moving <em>sands</em>, extends as far as the
sea-shore. These <em>sands</em> are collected by the winds, in many
spots, into hills 30 or 40 feet high. The wells at <i>Mabuk</i> afford
good water by digging to the depth of 10 or 12 feet.</p>

<p><em>Fifthly</em>, Once more leaving Suez; after having passed over
a small piece of marine and alluvial formation near the sea,
and taking a westerly direction, a narrow tract of <em>tertiary
sandstone</em>, so designated by Russegger, is observed; it is a
plain which gradually ascends from the shore of the Gulf, and
in it is placed the Castle of <i>Ajroud</i>; the water obtained there
is very bitter. Beyond this to the west, the plain becomes
<em>sandy</em>, and covered with black flints.</p>

<p>But the soil and hills at <i>Wadi Emshash</i>, which signify the
<q>Valley of the Waterpits,</q> near Ajroud, are calcareous:
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>the well there, called <i>Bir Emshash</i>, yields after rain good
drinking water. The hills around Ajroud consist of <em>tertiary
limestone</em> and <em>marl</em>. More to the south, Gebel Ataka divides
this formation, itself being a <em>secondary limestone</em> belonging
to the <em>cretaceous</em> series, and, according to Dr Robinson, is
strewed thickly with <em>flint</em> pebbles. It terminates in <i>Ras
Ataka</i>, or <q>Cape Deliverance,</q> on the Gulf. The sandy and
gravelly plain, <i>El Baidea</i>, the <i>Wadi Tawarik</i> of others, has
been named by some, the <q>Valley of Moses,</q> Wadi Mousa;
it communicates on the west with <i>Wadi-el-Tyh</i>.</p>

<p><i>Gebel Deraj</i> (steps) is limestone of the same cretaceous
series as Mount Ataka; and this formation stretches out
southwards to a great distance, constituting a large portion
of the East Egyptian Desert.</p>

<p>Then on the south of the former mountain, a band of
granite, which forms the northern ridge of <i>Gebel Kallala</i>, is
observed, wherein there exist remains of old <em>copper</em> mines.
Those called <i>Reigatamerih</i>, situate among low hills, <q>have
evidently been worked by the ancients, as well from the quantity
of pottery and <em>scoriæ</em> there, as from the remains of
miners' houses, and the regular manner in which the caverns
have been cut, following up the veins.</q><a name= "fnanchor_16" id= "fnanchor_16"></a><a href= "#footnote_16" class= "fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Near, on the <abbr title="southeast">SE.</abbr>, there is a well (<em>bir</em>) named <i>Horreh</i>,
whose water is bad, owing to the <em>sulphur</em> which it contains.
This is placed in <i>Wadi Araba</i>, an extensive valley, running in
a direction nearly due <abbr title="west">W.</abbr> and <abbr title="east">E.</abbr>, and descending from <i>Wadi
Chaderat</i> very rapidly to the shore of the gulf, which is here
termed by the Arabs <i>Mersa Zafraneh</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <q>Harbour of Saffron.</q>
The coast itself is flat and marshy. The headlands
on the south are a conglomerate, or <em>breccia</em> rock, of the <em>Tertiary</em>
formation, composed of shells, stones, and other substances,
held together by a calcareous cement. The Arabs
report, that a carriage-road anciently existed through the
Wadi Araba, and led to the Bay of Zafraneh. This, I conceive,
might have been the road of communication to the
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>Egyptian colonies and copper mines on the opposite Sinaic
peninsula, in <i>Wadi Maghara</i>, <i>Sarbut-el-Chadem</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and over
which the produce of those mines, having been shipped from
the harbour of Zelime to the Mersa Zafraneh, might have
been conveyed in waggons to the Nile. But, whether or not
the <i>Araba</i> mountains that rise a little to the south of the
opposite coast of the Peninsula had received the <em>same</em> appellation
from <em>this valley</em>, there seems to be no testimony to
decide. The <q>Monastery of St Antony</q>&mdash;<i>Deir Antonios</i>&mdash;distant
about 17 miles from the sea, is a fortified convent of
Copts, surrounded by a strong wall, of about 35 feet in height,
the entrance to which is by a trap-door, wherefrom a rope
descends, as in the present Sinaic convent. The keep, or
place of safety, is an insulated tower, defended by a drawbridge.
According to common statement, this was the abode
and place of burial of <i><abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Antony</i>, the founder of Monachism.
The mountains to the south, at the northern end of which
stands the convent, are <em>calcareous</em> (of the same <em>cretaceous</em>
formation), containing in places a great deal of <em>salt</em>. They
are known to the Arabs by the term of <i>Gebel Kallala</i>, and, in
fact, constitute the southern ridge of that chain. Another
large and similarly protected convent, called <i>Deir Bolos</i>
(Paul), distant from the former<a name= "fnanchor_17" id= "fnanchor_17"></a><a href= "#footnote_17" class= "fnanchor">[17]</a> about 15 miles in a direct
<abbr title="southeast">SE.</abbr> line, is situate in a picturesque place, and about
10 miles from the nearest point of the Gulf of Suez.
An adjoining garden abounds in date and other fruit-trees.
On the east, between this convent and the sea, <i>Wadi Girfeh</i>
is approached, among low hills: on the tops of some of
these the substructions of houses are visible, having been
built with uncemented stones. Also some chambers, or
catacombs, are cut in the rock: in the larger were found
crystals of <em>rock-salt</em>; the strata are composed of <em>limestone</em>,
and contain many fossils. Broken pieces of <em>terra cotta</em> vases,
chiefly red, are everywhere observed; and they, with other
vestiges, probably point out the site of a Roman colonial
town.</p>

<p><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>Proceeding from St Paul's to the <abbr title="southeast">SE.</abbr>, for near 15 miles,
the line of the <em>primitive</em> mountains is reached on the left,
whilst the <em>secondary</em> chain of Gebel Kallala, consisting of
limestone with ammonites, is continued on the right, or west.
South of Wadi Dthahal <em>micaceous schist</em> approaching to <em>gneiss</em>
occurs, and a little further, the primitive and <em>sandstone</em>, or
<em>gritstone</em> rocks join. Thence the secondary, or <em>cretaceous</em>
mountains, diverging to the south and south-west, gradually
decrease in altitude.</p>

<p>Again, southwards, some more ancient copper-works are
noticed; and then, <i>Gebel Horvashia</i>, whose formation is
<em>granite</em>, rises a few miles off to the <abbr title="southeast">SE.</abbr>; in its natural basin
much good water is retained after rain. <i>Wadi Abu Hadth</i>
next attracts attention from its possessing a good deal of
fine herbage, and many gum-arabic trees. Of the granite
mountains in this region, <i>Gebel Agrib</i>, or <i>Garib</i>, or <i>Gharib</i>
(<q>camel's hump</q>) is the loftiest, as it elevates itself to
about 6000 feet above the sea level; and from its position it
forms a conspicuous landmark far out at sea.</p>

<p>The ascent of this majestic mountain, from its steepness
and numerous ravines, is found to be fatiguing. Mr J. Wilkinson<a name= "fnanchor_18" id= "fnanchor_18"></a><a href= "#footnote_18" class= "fnanchor">[18]</a>
describes it as follows:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><q>The first evening we reached the base of the highest cone,
where we slept, and ascended the next morning to the summit, from
which we had a view of the mountains on either side of the sea, and
the different plains. We tracked the gazelles very nearly to the
summit, and every now and then in the ravines found some solitary
plants growing under the shade of a projecting stone. The peaks of
this mountain resemble the <i>Aiguilles</i> near Mount Blanc; but, to
equal that mountain in beauty, it requires the lower parts to be
covered with the woods and verdure of the Alps, and the desert plain
below to be exchanged for the green meadows of Switzerland. I
calculate the height to be 5513 feet above the ravine in the plain
below, which is a few hundred feet above the level of the sea.</q></p>

<p>About ten miles southward, <i>Bir-el-Dara</i>&mdash;the <q>Well of
Dara,</q> below the mountain of that name, occurs; there, likewise,
copper <em>scoriæ</em>, smelting furnaces, and miners' houses,
are observed.</p>

<p><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>Further south, more <em>copper mines</em> are seen in a bare place,
among low hills, all of which have been examined for the
ore.</p>

<p>Advancing south-eastwards by the plain, some <em>calcareous</em>
rocks are passed, and afterwards a line of <em>sandstone</em>,<a name= "fnanchor_19" id= "fnanchor_19"></a><a href= "#footnote_19" class= "fnanchor">[19]</a> with
limestone over it, running parallel to, and nearly equidistant
between the <em>two primitive</em> ridges. <i>Wadi-el-Enned</i> succeeds
to the eastward, where a beautifully clear rivulet is found;
but its water is too bad for the use of animals, being chiefly
serviceable for the nourishment of numerous date palms.
This spot lies at the foot of some <em>limestone</em> hills of the <em>cretaceous</em>
series that join the eastern <em>granitic</em> ridge.</p>

<p>Next, on the south, comes <i>Gebel Kuffra</i>, where the water
is so <em>salt</em> as only to be drunk by camels. <i>Gebel Dochan</i>,
(smoke)&mdash;the <q>Mons Porphyrites</q> of the ancients&mdash;rising
about eleven miles more southward, and in the same line with
the supposed site of <i>Myos Hormus</i>, Μuὸς Ὅρμος, the <q>mouse
harbour,</q> is too distant from our proposed limits, to receive
a full description in the present Memoir. I will only remark
that at Mount <i>Dochan</i>, there exist some interesting ruins, and
<q>those vast <em>quarries</em>, from which Rome took so many superb
pieces of <em>porphyry</em>, to adorn her baths and porticoes.</q><a name= "fnanchor_20" id= "fnanchor_20"></a><a href= "#footnote_20" class= "fnanchor">[20]</a> On its
southern side, Mr J. Wilkinson adds, <q>we met with some
<i>Breccia Verde</i>; and of other kinds of <i>Breccia</i> we had observed
great quantities and varieties at Dochan.</q> The sea-shore,
about Myos Hormus, is bare and deserted; to the west, at
some distance from the harbour, the <em>granitic</em> chain extends;
on the east, between it and the sea, a low ridge of <em>limestone</em>
hills, which unites with the primitive rocks on the north,
comes down towards the shore. <q>And, in the distance, on
the north, is seen the mountain <i>El Zeit</i>, so called from the
quantity of <em>petroleum</em> found there; whence project two small
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>headlands, forming two gulfs, at the entrance of which are
many long <em>sandbanks</em>. May not this be the '<i>mons Eos</i>' of
Pliny?</q><a name= "fnanchor_21" id= "fnanchor_21"></a><a href= "#footnote_21" class= "fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>This <i>Gebel Zeit</i>, or <q>Mount of Oil,</q> runs out into a promontory
on one side of the Strait of Jubal; at its foot a
copious supply of <em>Petroleum</em>, or rock oil, is obtained. It is
about as liquid as turpentine, of a black or dark-brown
colour, and is collected by the Greek Christians of Tur, who
take it there and sell it, for rheumatism and for healing
sores. The Arabs call it <i>Zeit-el-Gebel</i>&mdash;<q>oil of the mountain.</q></p>

<p>South of this promontory the sea is studded with a number
of small islands, some of which are described by Strabo;
all, however, I believe, except <i>Shadwan</i>, which is of secondary
limestone, are of recent marine formation&mdash;chiefly of
<em>Coral</em>.</p>

Ailah was in the middle ages considered (Robinson, <abbr title="1">i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 252, and Lepsius'
Tour, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 20), as <i>Elim</i>, the sixth station of the Israelites after they passed
the Red Sea. But I apprehend that the error very likely arose from the word
Αἰλὰμ occurring in the <i>Alexandrine MS.</i>, (2 Kings <abbr title="16">xvi.</abbr> 6; and 2 <abbr title="Chronicles 8">Chron.
viii.</abbr> 17), for Αἰλὰθ, which is used in the <span class="muchsmaller">LXX.</span>, in those verses. So Αἰλὰμ
had here been <em>mistaken</em> for Αἰλεὶμ, <i>Elim</i>, the word which is found in Exodus,
<abbr title="16">xvi.</abbr> 1; of the <span class="muchsmaller">LXX</span>.</p>

<a href="#fnanchor_25">[25]</a>
From Mr Glaisher's Hygrometrical Tables, the accuracy of which my
own series of observations made in the years 1847 and 1848, for the purpose
of testing their correctness, shew in a very striking manner; and I
think every meteorologist must feel himself greatly indebted to Mr Glaisher
for this valuable compilation, which is also based on observations made under
his own superintendence at the National Observatory.<br /><br />
In eight months of the year 1847, the difference between the observed and
the deduced Dew-point at Whitehaven, is 0°·10; and in 1848, it is only
0°·07, the mean of the two periods comprising 1220 observations, amounting
to the comparatively evanescent fraction of 8/100ths of a degree. Such
satisfactory proofs of the perfection of Mr G.'s tables have induced me to
abandon Daniell's Dew-point Apparatus, for that more simple, less costly, and
equally correct form of Hygrometer, the combination of the dry and wet
bulb thermometers.</p></td></tr>

<i>Form, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> of Instruments.</i></h4>

<p>The Barometer (the frame of which is brass) is a standard made
by Barrow, under the direction of James Glaisher, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, of the Greenwich
Observatory.</p>

<p>The adjustment for the difference of capacity of tube and cistern
is effected previous to every observation, and the correction for capillarity
and reduction to the temperature of 32° is made at the close
of each month.</p>

<p>The difference between its readings and those of the Greenwich
standard is scarcely appreciable, being only 0·002 inch.</p>

<p>The Dry and Wet Bulb Thermometers, also made by Barrow, are
considered to have identical readings under similar circumstances,
and both, too, agree with the Greenwich standard thermometer. The
Dew-point apparatus, now discontinued, approximates very closely in
its readings to the dry and wet bulb thermometers.</p>

<p>The Self-registering Thermometer is a large Six made by Dollond
in 1840, and its average difference from the standard is within 2/10ths
of a degree. A duplicate and precisely similar thermometer (which
has also been repeatedly compared with a standard at every part of
the scale) is fixed by its side, so that in case of No. 1 getting out
of order, No. 2 can be resorted to without detriment to the results.</p>

<p>These instruments all have a northern aspect, and are placed
about 4 feet above the ground. The naked thermometers employed
for indicating the relative amount of solar and terrestrial radiation,
are precisely similar to those in use at the Government Observatories.</p>

<p>The Rain and Evaporation Gauges are 8 inches in diameter, and
the metres are graduated to the 1/1000th part of an inch. Both are
read off daily. The aperture of the rain-gauge is about 7 feet above
the ground. The evaporation dish is mounted on a moveable stand,
4 feet 4 inches in height, and the circular shelf on which the vessel
rests, is just large enough to hold it. The gauge receives a fair
proportion of wind and sunshine, and is always exposed in the open
air during the day, except when <em>rain is falling</em>. At night and in
wet weather, it is placed under a capacious shed, 9 feet in height,
and open in front. Thus, it is conceived that the evaporating surface
is freely acted upon by all the circumstances concerned in promoting
this important natural process.</p>

<p>The direction of the wind is taken twice daily, and its force is
registered on an arbitrary scale from 0 to 6; the highest number is
reserved for storms approaching the hurricane in violence, and is
very rarely recorded.</p>

<h4><i>Remarks on the Weather in 1849.</i></h4>

<p><i>January.</i>&mdash;A damp wet month, except the first week, when sharp
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>frost prevailed. The mean temperature is 0°·68 <em>above</em> the average.
On the night between the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> and <abbr title="third">3d</abbr>, a naked thermometer on the
grass fell to 4°, and one on raw wool to 2°·8 below zero, being the
lowest temperature I have recorded. The radiation indicated by raw
wool was 21°·5. Between one and two o'clock on the morning of
the 10th, a terrific thunder-storm burst suddenly over the town, and
spread great alarm amongst the slumbering inhabitants. Seven or
eight dazzling discharges of the electric fluid, followed by deafening
crashes, succeeded each other in about as many minutes. The storm
was almost vertical; and between several of the flashes and the accompanying
thunder, there was scarcely an appreciable interval,
certainly not more than a single second of time. The war of the
elements ceased as suddenly as it commenced, and altogether, the
storm did not last more than ten minutes. The wind, which previously
blew a heavy gale, lulled almost to a calm as the last peal
died away. The storm was followed by a heavy fall of rain and
hail. It appears to have been pretty much confined to this town
and neighbourhood. Thunder was also heard on the evening of the
14th, and lightning was seen on the nights of the 21st, 26th, and
29th. Saturn's ring was perceived at this Observatory on the night
of the 31st, after a long continuance of damp, wet weather. As
this singular appendage was readily seen, and was well and sharply
defined, I have no doubt the instrument would have shewn it ten or
fourteen days earlier, had the nights been at all favourable. The
ring was also seen on the night of the 11th of September 1848, during
its temporary reappearance.</p>

<p><i>February.</i>&mdash;A fine, dry, and mild month. The temperature
3°·49 <em>above</em> the average of twelve years. On the 11th, the barometer
attained the remarkably high point of 30·82 at this Observatory,
which is about 90 feet above the sea level. At the Royal
Observatory, Greenwich (40 feet above sea), the maximum was
30·85, being greater than any reading since January 1825, when
the barometer at the Royal Society's apartments attained to 30·841,
at 81 feet above the sea level; and there is no other instance recorded
in the Philosophical Transactions of a reading so high as 30·8,
from the commencement of the series in 1774. The maxima of pressure
recorded on the 11th in various parts of the country, were all
found to give a reading of 30·90 at the mean sea level.</p>

<p>On the 18th, primroses were in flower on the cliffs between Panton
and Harrington.</p>

<p><i>March.</i>&mdash;Similar to February. Temperature 2°·29 <em>above</em> the
average, and the complement of the dew-point 2°·40 <em>below</em> the mean
of the two preceding years.</p>

<p><span class="sc">First Quarter.</span>&mdash;The temperature of the first quarter of 1849 is
2°·16 <em>above</em> the average of twelve years, and the complement of the
dew-point is 1°·52 <em>below</em> that of the corresponding quarter in the unhealthy
years 1847 and 1848.</p>

<p><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>The average fall of rain is 11·593 inches; in 1849, we have had
8·565, or 3·02 inches <em>below</em> the usual quantity.</p>

<p>The deaths in the quarter ending March 31, in the town and
suburb of Preston Quarter, are 168, being 16 <em>above</em> the corrected
quarterly average, which is 152. In the corresponding quarters of
1848 and 1849, the deaths were 250 and 187 respectively.</p>

<p>The deaths exceed the births by 25 in number.</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;A fine, dry, but cold month. The temperature 1°·95
below the average. On the 23d the cuckoo was heard, and on the
following day the swallow was seen in this neighbourhood. On Good
Friday, the 6th, two parhelia, accompanied by a halo, were seen
by a friend who was fishing by the river Calder. The sky was
covered with a thin cirro-stratus, so that the images did not present
any defined outline or disc, but consisted of three circular patches of
light of nearly equal intensity, so much so, that it was difficult to
distinguish the real from the phantom suns. The phenomena
were first noticed about 5 <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr class="speak">P.M.</abbr></span>, and they remained visible till near
six. The ring or halo passed through the centres of the parhelia,
one of which was to the left, and the other to the right of the sun,
with which they formed a straight line.</p>

<p><i>May.</i>&mdash;A fine month, with an average mean temperature. The
sun shone out on 29 days. The depth of rain is about an inch
<em>above</em> the average quantity.</p>

<p><i>June.</i>&mdash;A very dry month, and by far the coldest June I have
recorded in the last seventeen years. The mean temperature is no
less than 3°·67 below the average. The hay harvest began in this
neighbourhood about the 20th.</p>

<p>The thermometer on the grass, on raw wool, was below the freezing
point on eight nights; on the nights of the 8th and 10th it fell
to 27°·5, and on that of the 19th and 20th, to 25°. On several
mornings ice was seen in the immediate vicinity of the town, and on
the 3d of the month there was a somewhat heavy fall of snow amongst
the mountains. Highbell, Kentmere, High Street, and the mountains
around Mardale, were covered with the mantle of winter to the
depth of 6 inches. Such an incident has not occurred, it is said,
since 1827, when several sheep were lost and smothered in snow-drifts
on Mosedale and Helvellyn; and Skiddaw was covered with
snow. Both snow and hail are recorded on the 10th in the register
kept for me at Bassenthwaite Halls, at the foot of Skiddaw.</p>

<p>What is most remarkable, this unusual coldness does not appear
to have been experienced at all in the southern counties of England.
At Greenwich, the temperature is stated to be of the same value as
that of the average from 70 years, but less than that of the preceding
eight years, by 1°·9. According to Mr Glaisher's tables, published
in the Registrar-General's Report for the June quarter, the
mean temperature in Cornwall and Devonshire <em>exceeds</em> that of the
corresponding month in 1847, by 0°·7, and south of lat. 52°, it is in
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span>excess 9/10ths of a degree. Between the parallels 52° and 53°, the
temperature is 1°·2 <em>below</em> that of June 1847; between 53° and 54°,
it is 2°·1, and at Whitehaven, in lat. 54½°, it is 2°·7 below that of
June 1847.</p>

<p>The extraordinary depression in the temperature has therefore
been unparticipated in, by places situated south of the parallel
of 53°.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Second Quarter.</span>&mdash;The mean temperature of the quarter ending
June 30, is 1°·92 <em>below</em> the average of twelve preceding
years; and the difference between the air and dew-point temperatures
is 1°·32 <em>above</em> that of the corresponding quarter in the years
1847 and 1848.</p>

<p>The average fall of rain is 8·15 inches; in the second quarter of
1849, the fall is 5·74 inches, or 2·40 inches under the normal
quantity.</p>

<p>The deaths in the town and suburb are 139, being 21 above the
corrected average number, which is 117. In the June quarters of
1847 and 1848 the deaths were 177 and 147 respectively. The
births exceed the deaths by 59.</p>

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;Cold and wet. Temperature 1°·82 <em>below</em> the average.
The hay harvest began in this neighbourhood about the 20th June;
meadow hay was rather light on the ground, but the crop generally
was well secured.</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;Average temperature and depth of rain, with a serene
and stagnant atmosphere. The complement of the dew point is
1°·78 <em>below</em> the average of the month in the two preceding years.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;A fine, mild, and rather dry month, with serene
atmosphere. At the close of the month, several of the public fountains
were dry, and most of the pumps in the town had ceased to
yield their supplies.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Third Quarter.</span>&mdash;The temperature of the quarter ending September
30th is 0°·37 <em>below</em> the average, and the complement of the
dew-point, as compared with the two previous years, is 0°·5 <em>below</em>
the mean. The depth of rain is 0·36 inch under the average
quantity, which is 12·42 inches. The deaths in the third quarter
of 1849, in the town and suburb, are 168, or 47 above the corrected
average number; and, except in 1846, a greater number than has
occurred in any September quarter since the register was begun in
1839. In the September quarter of the last four years, the deaths
are as under: 1846, 255; 1847, 148; 1848, 142; and 1849,
168. The births exceed the deaths by six in number. During this
quarter we had a few cases of Asiatic cholera in this town, chiefly in
the month of September; and at the adjacent seaport of Workington
the disease was of a most malignant character, and exceedingly fatal.
The total number of deaths from the commencement of the epidemic
on the 13th of August, till it entirely ceased on the 6th of November,
was 172. In 1841, the population was 6041, which gives a
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span>mortality of 2·8 per cent., or one death in every 35 persons, from
cholera. It is, however, believed that the population of Workington
has decreased since the last census was taken; and at the time the
epidemic was raging, most of the respectable inhabitants had left the
place; so that the ratio of mortality amongst the then residents
must have been considerably greater than is here stated. A singular
fact connected with the disease is its sudden cessation for several
days, at the expiration of which it returns with increased virulence.
In the week between the 25th and 31st of August, the deaths were
65; from the 31st August to the 8th September there were none;
on the 8th, 12; 9th and 10th, none; on the 11th, 13; and on the
12th only one death; 13th, 11; from the 14th to the 19th inclusive,
the deaths averaged 2·5 daily, but on the 20th they rose to
13; and between the 21st and the end of September there were only
eight deaths, which occurred on the 21st, <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr>, 25th, and 27th.</p>

<p>Between the 1st and 20th of October the deaths were 32, and
during that period there were frequently none for three or four consecutive
days. There was only one death after the 20th October.
It occurred on the 6th of November, when the pestilence ceased. I
am informed by a resident medical gentleman, that at the commencement
of the disease the cases were rapidly fatal, many of them after
eight or ten hours' illness, and it was then almost entirely confined to
the lower classes.</p>

<p>The proximate cause of the exceedingly fatal character of the disease
at this seaport is probably to be found in the effluvia engendered
by the extensive tract of marshy land, called the <q>Cloffocks,</q> adjoining
the river Derwent, and in the immediate vicinity of the town.
What is most remarkable, the first case of cholera at Workington
occurred on the same day of the same month, in the same house, and
even in the same room in the said house, where the epidemic first
broke out in the summer of 1832. There is no peculiarity in the
situation of the house, nor can any reason be assigned for this most
singular coincidence. I am informed that very few insects were seen
about the river, and, during the height of the disease, the rooks
entirely forsook their old-established quarters in the grounds adjoining
the Hall.<a name= "fnanchor_29" id= "fnanchor_29"></a><a href= "#footnote_29" class= "fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;Cold, with an average fall of rain (5¼ inches.) The
mean temperature is 2°·5 <em>below</em> the average. The grain crops were
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>above an average in point of quantity, and they were got under
cover in excellent condition. Garden fruit, as pears, apples, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
were not so plentiful as usual. On the evening of the 28th, that
rare phenomenon a lunar rainbow, was seen from the grounds at
Tarn Bank, near Cockermouth, by Isaac Fletcher, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, to whom
I am indebted for the following description of it:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the early part of the evening the sky was clear, but at 8<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup>
a dense mist rose from the river Derwent and entirely overspread
a large segment of the northern horizon; whilst to the south, the
atmosphere continued comparatively clear, the moon, within four
days of full, shining brightly near the meridian. About 9<sup>h</sup> 10<sup>m</sup>,
there was a faint luminous arch in the north, which was evidently
a lunar rainbow, or rather a fog-bow, for no rain whatever was
visible at the time. The light reflected by the arch was white,
and perfectly free from prismatic colour. Its breadth was considerable,
perhaps 4° or 5°, and its centre or highest part, passed
close under the star [Greek:b] Ursæ Majoris, so that the extreme altitude
of the arch was probably about 18° or 20°. The edges were
not sharply defined, but gradually shaded off. It was noticed that
the denser the fog became, the more apparent was the arch, and
<i>vice versa</i>, so that the phenomenon could not have been of an auroral
character. The phenomenon was watched for ten or fifteen minutes,
when the gradual dispersion of the fog, by destroying the refracting
medium, put an end to this interesting appearance.</p>

<p><i>November.</i>&mdash;As usual, a very dull, damp month, with but little
difference between the temperature of the days and nights. Temperature
1°·20 <em>above</em> the average.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 2d, a swallow was seen on the
wing in the immediate vicinity of this town. The maximum temperature
of the day was 55°. Between the 9th and 12th inclusive,
the extremes of day and night temperature only varied 2 degrees.</p>

<p><i>December.</i>&mdash;A fine dry month with occasional frosty nights.
Temperature 2°·15, and rain 2·19 inches <em>below</em> the average. Two
loud peals of thunder and much lightning on the night of the 14th.</p>

<p>The remarkable meteor observed at Edinburgh on the evening of
the 19th, and minutely described by Professor Forbes who witnessed
it, was also seen at Whitehaven under the same circumstances
and at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Last Quarter.</span>&mdash;The mean temperature of the last quarter of
1849 is 1°·15 <em>below</em> the average, and the complement of the dew-point
is 0°·87 <em>below</em> the mean of the two preceding years. The
average depth of rain for the quarter is 14·64 inches; in 1849
the quarterly fall is 12·62 inches, or 2·02 inches <em>under</em> the normal
quantity. The deaths in this quarter, in the town and suburbs, are
131, being 4 <em>below</em> the average number.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to have to announce a favourable change in the
sanitary condition of this town, and to record the termination of an
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>excessive mortality, which uninterruptedly prevailed for a period of
two years and a half; for this is the only quarterly period wherein
the deaths have not exceeded the average since March 1846.</p>

<p>In the corresponding quarters of 1846, 1847, and 1848, the
deaths were 215, 161, and 176 respectively. The births exceed
the deaths by 34.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Aurora Borealis.</span>&mdash;There have been seven exhibitions of
the aurora borealis during the year 1849, two of which were sufficiently
remarkable to merit something more than a passing notice.</p>

<p>The first occurred on the evening of January 14th. At 10 <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr class="speak">P.M.</abbr></span>,
a well-defined auroral arch, about 5° in width, extended from <abbr title="north northeast">NNE.</abbr>
to <abbr title="west">W.</abbr>, its highest part reaching nearly to Arided in Cygnus. At
11<sup>h</sup> there was one complete arch, and segments of two other arches,
all brilliant, crossing each other in the <abbr title="northwest">NW.</abbr>, and throwing off intensely
bright streamers, some of which reached the altitude of the
Pointers. The aurora was now exceedingly beautiful, and emitted
considerable light. The streamers appeared to have a duplex lateral
motion, running along the upper edge of the arch from west to
north, and then backwards from north to west. The clear sky beneath
the arches was almost black, from contrast. At 11<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup> the
arches had broken up, and the streamers appeared to emanate from
the horizon.</p>

<p><i>February 18.</i>&mdash;At 9 <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr class="speak">P.M.</abbr></span> there was a brilliant band of auroral
light in the east about 6° in width, which shot upwards towards the
zenith, throwing off short lateral streamers. At times, a complete
arch of varying width extended from the eastern to the western
horizon; at others, it was broken up into two or more detached portions.
At 9<sup>h</sup> 45<sup>m</sup>, a magnificent rainbow-like arch about 2° in
width, spanned the heavens from <abbr title="east northeast">ENE.</abbr> to <abbr title="west southwest">WSW.</abbr> The altitude of
the centre was apparently about 75°; the lower edge, at or near the
highest point of the arch, was bounded by the star Castor. The
arch was beautifully defined, and of perfectly even width throughout
its entire extent; it disappeared in a few minutes after my attention
was called to it, and soon after the sky became overcast. But for
the absence of the moon, it might easily have been mistaken for a
lunar rainbow. A precisely similar arch made its appearance here
on the evening of the 21st of March 1833, and as far as my observation
goes, these perfect rainbow-like arches are of exceedingly rare
occurrence.</p>

<p>The following phenomenon though unconnected with auroræ, is
probably of electric origin; and, as an unusual atmospheric appearance,
is worthy of being placed on record:&mdash;<i>September 16.</i>&mdash;The
sky was mostly overcast throughout the day, except a segment extending
from <abbr title="west southwest">WSW.</abbr> to <abbr title="east northeast">ENE.</abbr>, which was bright and clear to an
altitude of about 15°. The upper boundary of the clear blue space
was an elliptical segment formed by a sheet of white cloud, which
was partially illuminated towards the western extremity, and somewhat
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>resembled an auroral arch. I first noticed this blue arch about
3 <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr class="speak">P.M.</abbr></span>, and from that time until it disappeared, about six o'clock,
there was not the slightest apparent change, either in its altitude or
position. It was observed as early as 7 o'clock in the morning,
when it was, nearer to the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="sc">General Remarks.</span>&mdash;The year 1849 is the driest we have had
since 1844; the fall of rain (39 inches) is 7·9 inches under the
average annual depth, which is 47 inches nearly. From some
cause, the annual quantity of rain at this place is evidently on the
decrease, and the diminution is, I believe, general all over the north
of England. Probably the large amount of moor and waste marshy
land brought into cultivation of late years, and the more efficient
drainage of the country generally, by diminishing the evaporating
surface, and so interfering with that invisible process of nature which
is the source of every kind of atmospheric deposition, may have led to
this and other changes which appear to have occurred in the climate
of England within the last half century. In the first seven years
(1833-39) after I began to keep a meteorological record, the average
annual depth of rain was 49·93 inches, or 50 inches nearly; in the
last seven years, ending with 1848, the average is reduced to 43·74
inches. The greatest quantity in the last 17 years is 59 inches, in
1836; the least, 34·69 inches in 1842. The three driest years in the
period are 1842, 1844, and 1849, which yielded 34·69 inches, 36·72
inches, and 39 inches.</p>

<p>The temperature of the past year (48°·69) is about half a degree
<em>below</em> the climatic mean, which is 49°·02. The coldest year of the
last 17 was 1845, and the mildest, 1846; the mean temperatures
of these years were 47°·49 and 50°·85 respectively.</p>

<p>The naked thermometer on the grass, placed on raw wool, has
been at or below the freezing point in every month of 1849; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,
in January, on 19 nights; in February, on 14; in March, on
13; in April, on 18; in May, on 11; in June, on 8; in
July, on 1; in August, on 2; in September, on 5; in October,
on 16; in November, on 13; and in December, on 24 nights.
The amount of radiant heat thrown off from the earth's crust
at night, in the year 1849, as indicated by naked thermometers
placed on raw wool and on grass, is much greater than usual. The
evaporation exceeds the fall of rain in five months of 1849; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, in
March, April, May, June, and September. In 1849, we have had
12 perfectly clear days; 163 days more or less cloudy but without
rain; 190 wet days; 261 days on which the sun shone out; 33
days of frost; 13 of hail; 7 of snow; 10 of thunder and lightning;
and 7 days in which lightning occurred without thunder. There
have also been three lunar halos, one lunar rainbow, a double parhelion,
and seven appearances of the aurora borealis.</p>

<p>The clear days are 14, the days of sunshine are 13, and the wet
days are 8 <em>less</em> than the average number. The past year has therefore
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>afforded a smaller share of blue sky and a less amount of sunshine
than usual, although the depth of rain and the number of
wet days are both <em>below</em> the average for the locality.</p>

<p>The quantity of electricity in the air was extremely small down
to the end of July, after which it was restored to its average amount.</p>

<p>This fact is strikingly exhibited by the following table of continuous
observations taken by M. Quetelet with Peltier's electrometer:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

</table>

<p>In 1849, the deaths exceed the calculated average number by
79, and the births exceed the deaths by 74.</p>

<p>In the seven years ending with 1845, the mean annual number of
deaths in the town and suburb, with an assumed population of
17,867, is 410, being 22·9 per thousand, or one death in every 43·5
persons. In 1846, 1847, and 1848 (assumed average population
18,329), the mean annual number is 694, being 37·8 deaths
per thousand, or 1 in every 26·4 persons in those three most unhealthy
years. In 1849 the deaths are 606, which, assuming the
population to be the same as in 1848, give 32·2 deaths per 1000, or
1 death in every 31 persons. The average annual number of deaths
in the ten years 1839-48 is 495, which, with an assumed population
of 17,713, gives 27·9 per 1000, or 1 death in every 35·7
inhabitants.</p>

<p>So that the mortality in 1849, although still above the average,
shews a marked improvement in the health of the town as compared
with any of the three preceding years; and, in the last quarter, the
deaths are below the average for the period.</p>

The cause of this fearful epidemic is still a mystery. The meteorological
conditions of the atmosphere, although slightly abnormal, are wholly inadequate
to account for its induction. It is most probably induced by some gaseous
poison diffused through the atmosphere, but of a nature so subtle that the most
delicate analysis fails to detect its presence. According to the experiments of
Dr Dundas Thompson of Glasgow, no solid matter existed in the air, but ammonia
was obtained from it in the proportion of 0·319 grain of caustic ammonia,
or 0·731 grain of carbonate of ammonia, to 1000 pounds of air.</p>

to the American Exploratory Expedition, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2">The Coral Island, in its best condition, is but a miserable residence
for man. There is poetry in every feature; but the natives find
this a poor substitute for the bread-fruit and yams of more favoured
lands. The cocoa-nut and pandanus are, in general, the only
products of the vegetable kingdom afforded for their sustenance, and
fish and crabs from the reef their only animal food. Scanty, too,
is the supply; and infanticide is resorted to in self-defence, where
but a few years would otherwise overstock the half-dozen square
miles of which their little world consists.</p>

<p>Yet there are more comforts than might be expected on a land of
so limited extent, without rivers, without hills, in the midst of salt
water, with the most elevated point but ten feet above high tide, and
no part more than 300 yards from the ocean. Though the soil is
light and the surface often strewed with blocks of coral, there is a dense
covering of vegetation to shade the native villages from a tropical sun.
The cocoa-nut&mdash;the tree of a thousand uses&mdash;grows luxuriantly on the
coral-made land, after it has emerged from the ocean; and the scanty
dresses of the natives, their drinking-vessels and other utensils,
mats, cordage, fishing-lines, and oil, besides food, drink, and building
material, are all supplied from it. The <i>Pandanus</i>, or screw-pine,
flourishes well, and is exactly fitted for such regions: as it enlarges
and spreads its branches, one prop after another grows out from
the trunk and plants itself in the ground; and by this means its base
is widened and the growing tree supported. The fruit, a large
ovoidal mass, made up of oblong dry seed, diverging from a centre,
each near two cubic inches in size, affords a sweetish-husky article
of food, which, though little better than prepared corn-stalks, admits
of being stored away for use when other things fail. The extensive
reefs abound in fish which are easily captured; and the natives, with
wooden hooks, often bring in larger kinds from the deep waters.
From such resources a population of 10,000 persons is supported on
the single Island of Taputeouea, whose whole habitable area does not
exceed six square miles.<a name= "fnanchor_30" id= "fnanchor_30"></a><a href= "#footnote_30" class= "fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Water is usually to be found in sufficient quantities for the use of
the natives, although the land is so low and flat. They dig wells five
to ten feet deep in any part of the dry islets, and generally obtain a
constant supply. These wells are sometimes fenced around with
special care; and the houses of the villages, as at Fakaafo, are often
clustered about them. On Aratica (Carlshoff) there is a watering-place
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>50 feet in diameter, from which our vessels in a few hours
obtained 390 gallons. The Tarawan Islands are generally provided
with a supply sufficient for bathing, and each native takes his morning
bath in fresh water, esteemed by them a great luxury.</p>

<p>The only source of this water is the rains, which, percolating
through the loose surface, settle upon the hardened coral rock that
forms the basis of the island. As the soil is white, or nearly so, it
receives heat but slowly, and there is consequently but little evaporation
of the water that is once absorbed.</p>

<p>These islands, moreover, enclose ports of great extent, many
admitting even the largest class of vessels; and the same lagoons
are the pearl fisheries of the Pacific.</p>

<p>An occasional log drifts to their shores; and at some of the more
isolated atolls, where the natives are ignorant of any land but the
spot they inhabit; they are deemed direct gifts from a propitiated
deity. These drift-logs were noticed by Kotzebue, at the Marshall
Islands, and he remarked also that they often brought stones in their
roots. Similar facts were observed by us at the Tarawan group, and
also at Enderby's Island, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The stones at the Tarawan Islands, as far as we could learn, are
generally basaltic, and they are highly valued for whetstones, pestles,
and hatchets. The logs are claimed by the chiefs for canoes.
Some of the logs on Enderby's Island were forty feet long, and four
in diameter.</p>

<p>Fragments of pumice and resin are transported by the waves to
the Tarawan Islands. We were informed that the pumice was
gathered from the shores by the women, and pounded up to fertilize
the soil of their taro patches; and it is so common, that one woman
will pick up a peck in a day. Pumice was also met with at Fakaafo.
Volcanic ashes are sometimes distributed over these islands, through
the atmosphere; and in this manner the soil of the Tonga Islands is
improved, and in some places it has received a reddish colour.</p>

<p>The officers of the <q>Vincennes</q> observed several large masses of
compact and cellular basalt on Rose Island, a few degrees east of
Samoa: they lie two hundred yards inside of the line of breakers.
The island is uninhabited, and the origin of the stories is doubtful;
they may have been brought there by roots of trees, or perhaps by
some canoe.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great number of coral islands in the Paumotu
Archipelago, the botanist finds there, as Dr Pickering informs me,
only twenty-eight or twenty-nine native species of plants. The following
are the most common of them: <i>Portulacca</i>, two species;
<i>Scævola Konigii</i>. <i>Pisonia?</i> one species; <i>Tournefortia sericea</i>; <i>Pandanus
odoratissimus</i>; <i>Lepidium</i>, one species; <i>Euphorbia</i>, one
species; <i>Morinda citrifolia</i>; <i>B&oelig;rhavia</i>, two species; <i>Cassytha</i>, one
species; <i>Heliotropium prostratum</i>, <i>Pemphis acidula</i>, <i>Guettarda
speciosa</i>, <i>Triumphetta procumbens</i>, <i>Sauriana maritima</i>; <i>Convolvulus</i>,
one species; <i>Urtica</i>, one or two species; <i>Asplenium nidus</i>;
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span><i>Achyranthus</i>, one species; a species of grass. One or two rubiaceous
shrubs. <i>Polypodium</i>.</p>

<p>On Rose Island, Dr Pickering found only the <i>Pisonia</i> and a <i>Portulacca</i>.
The <i>Triumphetta procumbens</i>, a creeping plant, takes root,
like the <i>Portulacca</i>, in the most barren sands, and is very common.
The <i>Tournefortia</i> and <i>Scævola</i> are also among the earliest species.
The <i>Pisonia</i>, a tree of handsome foliage, the <i>Pandanus</i>, or screw-pine,
and the cocoa-nut (always an introduced species), constitute the
larger part of the forests. In the Marshall group, where the vegetation
is more varied, Chamisso observed fifty-two native plants, and,
in a few instances, the banana, taro, and bread-fruit.</p>

<p>The language of the natives indicates their poverty, as well as the
limited productions and unvarying features of the land. All words,
like those for mountain, hill, river, and many of the implements of
their ancestors, as well as the trees and other vegetation of the land
from which they are derived, are lost to them; and as words are but
signs for ideas, they have fallen off in general intelligence. It
would be an interesting inquiry for the philosopher, to what extent
a race of men, placed in such circumstances, are capable of mental
improvement. Perhaps the query might be best answered by another:
How many of the various arts of civilized life could exist in a land
where shells are the only cutting instruments? The plants, in all
but twenty-nine in number,&mdash;but a single mineral,&mdash;quadrupeds,
none, with the exception of foreign mice,&mdash;fresh water barely enough
for household purposes,&mdash;no streams, nor mountains, nor hills!
How much of the poetry or literature of Europe would be intelligible
to persons whose ideas had expanded only to the limits of a coral
island,&mdash;who had never conceived of a surface of land above half a
mile in breadth, of a slope higher than a beach, of a change of
seasons beyond a variation in the prevalence of rains? What elevation
in morals should be expected upon a contracted islet, so readily
overpeopled that threatened starvation drives to infanticide, and
tends to cultivate the extremest selfishness? Assuredly, there is
not a more unfavourable spot for moral or intellectual development in
the wide world than the Coral Island, with all its beauty of grove and
lake.</p>

<p class="moreafter">These islands are exposed to earthquakes and storms, like the
continents, and occasionally a devastating wave sweeps across the
land. During the heavier gales the natives sometimes secure their
houses by tying them to the cocoa-nut trees, or to a stake planted
for the purpose. A height of ten or twelve feet, the elevation of
their land, is easily overtopped by the more violent seas; and great
damage is sometimes experienced. The still more extensive earthquake
waves, such as those which have swept up the coast of
Spain, Peru, and the Sandwich Islands, would produce a complete
deluge over these islands.&mdash;(<cite>United States' Exploring Expedition.&mdash;Geology.</cite>&mdash;<cite>By

"fnanchor">[31]</a><br />Communicated by the Author.</p>

<p class="p2">Again, to bring to your recollection the numerous works
which have placed Pilla among the most eminent geologists
of Italy, is to do honour to the memory of an associate, whose
recent loss we lament, by bestowing well-merited praises on
the greatness of mind in a citizen, who nobly sacrificed a life
already illustrious, and which the future promised to render
still more so, to the good of his country. Yes, Italy has
always been <i lang="la">tellus magna virum!</i> The chances of war, the
rage of civil discord, the insults of foreign domination, may
have eclipsed its political name, but they could not extinguish
its genius. The blast of revolutions has respected the triple
halo with which the sciences, letters, and the arts, have
adorned its brow. By entrusting to one of his friends the
task of enumerating his scientific labours, the Society imposes
on him a very painful duty; but he undertakes it with
feeling and gratitude; for the public homage rendered to the
virtues of those whom we have loved, seems to bring them
back to us, and softens the awards of destiny, which has too
soon snatched them from us.</p>

<p>Leopold Pilla was born in the kingdom of Naples. While
still young, the exciting scenes of Vesuvius attracted his attention,
and determined his scientific career. In 1832, he
undertook to write the annals of this volcano, and gave its
history in two periodical collections.<a name= "fnanchor_32" id= "fnanchor_32"></a><a href= "#footnote_32" class= "fnanchor">[32]</a> It was at this period
that he proved the production of flames in volcanic eruptions,
and deduced from thence the ingenious conclusions which
you judged worthy of a place in your memoirs.<a name= "fnanchor_33" id= "fnanchor_33"></a><a href= "#footnote_33" class= "fnanchor">[33]</a> This remarkable
work, which of itself would have been sufficient to
establish his scientific reputation, was soon followed by
numerous others, which shed a new lustre on his name. The
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>study of the extinct volcano of Rocca Monfina,<a name= "fnanchor_34" id= "fnanchor_34"></a><a href= "#footnote_34" class= "fnanchor">[34]</a> in the Campania,
illustrated the theory of craters <i lang="fr">de soulevement</i>, and
enriched it with facts of the highest importance.</p>

<p>With a mind at once philosophical and cultivated, he was
able to generalise and describe, to unite erudition with good
taste, and to treat questions of deepest science with that
grace and picturesqueness of style, which renders them popular
without detracting from their accuracy. His love for
geology amounted to enthusiasm; he was therefore so zealous
in propagating his views, that certain jealous minds could
not pardon him, and led him to atone for his fault, by a voluntary
exile. The apostle of the science, he likewise was
its martyr; thus nothing was wanting to his fame. It is the
privilege of men of genius to be persecuted. Obliged to
yield to the storm, Pilla left Naples, but by his writings he
belonged to Italy at large; and the unanimous acclamation
which greeted him in the chair formerly occupied by Galileo,
conferred on him by the liberality of the Grand Duke of
Tuscany, formed at once his triumph and revenge.</p>

<p>Besides the works mentioned, we owe to him a Mineralogical
Treatise on Rocks;<a name= "fnanchor_35" id= "fnanchor_35"></a><a href= "#footnote_35" class= "fnanchor">[35]</a> an Introduction to the Study of
Mineralogy;<a name= "fnanchor_36" id= "fnanchor_36"></a><a href= "#footnote_36" class= "fnanchor">[36]</a> and a Geological Itinerary from Naples to
Vienna.<a name= "fnanchor_37" id= "fnanchor_37"></a><a href= "#footnote_37" class= "fnanchor">[37]</a> Thus, by approving the new productions which
his activity produced, and which caused him to be better appreciated
by the nation which had adopted him, the Tuscans
had only to sanction the judgment they had already given of
our <i lang="fr">savant</i>, founded on his reputation and works.</p>

<p>Pilla left his heart at Naples. That city contained all the
objects of his affections&mdash;a father, who had guided his first
attempts in the field of science, and his family&mdash;a classical soil
which had revealed to him the secret of its revolutions, a majestic
landscape, which he could not find among the monotonous
plains of Pisa, and above all <em>his own</em> Vesuvius. It was
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>in this way that he recalled to his mind the mountain which
had been the subject of his daily study, and from whose summit
nature presented herself to his eyes in the most striking
contrasts, revealing to his view its subterranean convulsions,
connected with the delightful picture of the Gulf of Baia. All
his thoughts brought him back to Naples. When, from the
height of the terraces of Campiglia our view extended from
the peaks of Mount Amiata to the banks of the Popolonia,
and from the Tuscan Archipelago to the distant horizons of
Corsica and Sardinia, my poor friend often interrupted our
reveries by saying,&mdash;<q>It is almost as beautiful as Naples,
but my Vesuvius is wanting;</q> and then adding, <q>How unfortunate
it is that Werner did not lay the foundation of
geology at Naples; <em>he would have made it Plutonian</em>.</q> Thus
the love of his country, and the recollection of its wonders,
were confounded in his mind with the cultivation of the
science, and gave to his animated and poetical conversation
a touching melancholy which agreeably tempered his vivacity.</p>

<p>During the years of his professorship at Pisa, Pilla published,
in succession, a comparative Essay on the formations
which compose the soil of Italy;<a name= "fnanchor_38" id= "fnanchor_38"></a><a href= "#footnote_38" class= "fnanchor">[38]</a> a Collection of the Mineral
riches of Tuscany;<a name= "fnanchor_39" id= "fnanchor_39"></a><a href= "#footnote_39" class= "fnanchor">[39]</a> two Memoirs on the Etrurian Formation;<a name= "fnanchor_40" id= "fnanchor_40"></a><a href= "#footnote_40" class= "fnanchor">[40]</a>
History of an Earthquake felt in Tuscany, in 1846;<a name= "fnanchor_41" id= "fnanchor_41"></a><a href= "#footnote_41" class= "fnanchor">[41]</a>
many notices respecting the Calcare-rosso, and on the temperature
observed in the wells of Monte-Massi;<a name= "fnanchor_42" id= "fnanchor_42"></a><a href= "#footnote_42" class= "fnanchor">[42]</a> lastly, the
first volume of his Treatise on Geology.<a name= "fnanchor_43" id= "fnanchor_43"></a><a href= "#footnote_43" class= "fnanchor">[43]</a> The entire work
would have formed four octavo volumes. The materials were
prepared, but death left the work incomplete. As these
various writings are in the hands of all geologists, we give
no analysis of them; which indeed would only be a faint reflection
from the pictures present to your memory. I may
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>merely say, that the elevated considerations of the general
physics of the globe to which he has risen in appreciating
and investigating the causes of earthquakes, the comprehensive
and methodical plan on which he has projected this geological
treatise, by affording us a proof of the fertility and
maturity of his mind, shew us, at the same time, the importance
of the part reserved for a philosopher, whom death has
removed from the present scene before he had reached his
thirty-sixth year.</p>

<p>The war of independence raged at the time when Pilla
was about to visit the north of Europe, in order to complete
his studies in practical geology, by comparing the different
formations. Every generous heart in Italy beat high
at the report of the insurrection of Milan; and the Universities
of Pisa and Sienna, by demanding arms and first flying
to the scene of danger, shewed that hearts, proved in the fire
of science, are prepared for great things. Pilla marched at
the head of his pupils, and led them in the path of glory, as
he had done in that of philosophy. The love of country and
thirst for independence, by subjugating his heart, had stifled
the calculation of reason under the impulse and delirium of
enthusiasm. He had foreseen the issue of the struggle;
for he said to me some days before setting out for the plains
of Lombardy, <q>the hour of our fall has struck. Italy loses
by fourteen ages of servitude the splendour of her early
days. They are leading us to slaughter; but we must teach
our children how to die, in order that they may know how
they may one day become free.</q></p>

<p class="moreafter">The University legion formed a small corps which was
placed on the right wing of the Piedmontese army, and
occupied the positions of Curtatone and Montanara. The
principal effort of the Austrian army was directed against
these lines, in the affair of the 29th May 1848. Attacked by
13,000 imperial troops, the Tuscans resisted courageously,
and did not fall back till they had left 250 of their men on
the field of battle. Their heroic resistance paved the way
for the success of Goito. Pilla was found among the dead.</p>

<p class="center">According to the views of <span class="sc">M. Brongniart</span>.</p>

<p class="center smaller">(<i>Continued from <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 330 of Volume 48.</i>)</p>

<p class="p2"><q><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <i>Permian Period.</i>&mdash;The nature of the vegetables which
appear peculiar to this epoch, is far from being determined
in a positive manner; for the few localities where the fossils
we consider as belonging to it, have hitherto been found, are
not perhaps really of a formation very identical and truly contemporaneous.
For it may be asked, whether the bituminous
and copper slates of the county of Mansfield, classed by all
geologists with the zechstein, and the sandstone of Russia,
placed by M. M. Murchison and Verneuil in their Permian
formation, are really contemporaneous? Finally, is there
greater reason for classifying the slates of Lodève, considered
by M. M. Dufresnoy and Elie de Beaumont as depending on
the variegated sandstone, but so different from the same
sandstone of the Vosges in its <i>flora</i>, in this period, which
would thus be a kind of passage from the coal period, so well
characterised, to the vosgian or variegated sandstone, which
differs from it in so decided a manner?</q></p>

<p>On account of these doubts, M. Brongniart indicates these
three floras separately; <i>1st</i>, The Flora of the bituminous slates
of Thuringia, composed of algæ, ferns, and coniferæ; <i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>,
The Flora of the Permian sandstones of Russia, which comprehends
ferns, equisetaceæ, lycopodiaceæ, and n&oelig;ggerathiæ;
<i><abbr title="third">3d</abbr></i>, The Flora of the slates of Lodève, which is composed of
ferns, asterophylliteæ, and coniferæ.</p>

<p>"We perceive that there are great specific differences between
the plants of these localities, and that hitherto no
species common to them has been found. Must we ascribe
these differences to the influence of the great diversity of
geographical position, or is there, besides, a difference in the
period of their origin among these formations? The only
character which tends to bring these two latter Floras near
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>each other, is the relation which both of them bear to the coal-formations,
of which they seem to be a kind of extract,
reminding us more especially of the most recent beds.</p>

<p>"With regard to the plants of the bituminous slates of the
Mansfeld district, they are so few in number, and appear to
have been deposited in conditions so different, that we can
with difficulty compare them with the two other Floras. Yet
the species of Sphenopteris are extremely like each other in
the three formations, and an exact comparison would perhaps
establish the identity of many of them. The Pecopteris
crenulata of Ilmenau, is only perhaps an imperfect state of
the Pecopteris abbreviata of Lodève; lastly, the Callipteris
of the Permian formation of Lodève have a very close connection
between themselves and the Callipteris of the coal-formation.</p>

<p>"We may add, with regard to the bituminous slates of
Thuringia, that many of these fossils appear to be marine
plants, whose numbers would become much more considerable
if we did not suppress all the imperfect impressions which
have been described as such, and which are nothing more
than fragments of ferns or altered coniferæ.</p>

<p>"<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <span class="sc">Reign of the Gymnosperms.</span>&mdash;During the preceding
periods, and particularly during the Carboniferous period, the
Acrogenous cryptogams predominated, and the Gymnospermous
dicotyledons, less numerous, shewed themselves in unusual
forms, and sometimes so anomalous that we are in
doubt whether to place them in this or the preceding department;
such are the Asterophylliteæ. At a later period, on
the contrary, these anomalous and ambiguous forms, whose
classification is often obscure, disappear; Acrogenous cryptogams
and Gymnospermous dicotyledons evidently enter into
families still existing, differing from them only in generic
forms; the Ferns and Equisetaceæ, which represent the acrogens,
are less numerous; the Coniferæ and Cycadeæ almost
equal them in number, and usually exceed them in frequency,
especially in the second period; by their abundance and size
they afford the essential character of all these formations;
lastly, the Angiospermous dicotyledons are wholly wanting,
and the monocotyledons are in very small numbers.</p>

<p><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>"This reign of the Gymnospermous dicotyledons is divided
into two periods; the first, in which the Coniferæ predominate,
and in which the Cycadeæ scarcely appear; the second,
in which this family becomes predominating in the number
of species, in frequency and variety of generic forms. The
latter may be divided into many epochs, each presenting peculiar
characters.</p>

<p>"<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <i>Vosgian Period.</i>&mdash;This period, which does not appear
to have been of long duration, and comprehends only
the <em>variegated</em> sandstone properly so called, presents the following
characters; <i>1st</i>, The existence of ferns, pretty numerous,
of forms very often anomalous, evidently constituting
genera now extinct, and which are not found even in the
most recent formations; such are the Anomopteris and the
Crematopteris. Stems of arborescent ferns are more frequent
than during the Jurassic period; true Equisetums are
very rare; the Calamites, or rather perhaps the Calamodendrons,
are abundant. <i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>, The Gymnosperms are represented
by two genera of Coniferæ, <i>Voltzia</i> and <i>Haidingeria</i>, of which
the species and specimens are very numerous. The Cycadeæ,
on the contrary, are very rare. M. Schimper mentions only
two species founded on two unique specimens of a very imperfect
character, and the determination of which may be considered
doubtful.</p>

<p>"This consideration appears to me to separate completely,
in a botanical point of view, the period of the variegated
sandstone from that of the Keuper, although both are placed
by geologists in the trias-formation. For the Cycadeæ become
very abundant in the Keuper, are perfectly characterised,
and often analogous to those of the Jurassic period; while
the Coniferæ of the variegated sandstone are, on the contrary,
wanting in this formation.</p>

<p>"<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> <i>Jurassic Period.</i>&mdash;This period is one of the most extensive
by the formations which it comprehends, and the
variety of different special epochs of vegetation which it embraces;
although we cannot refuse to comprehend, under a
common title, epochs during which very analogous forms have
succeeded each other. It thus comprehends from the Keuper
inclusively, up to the Wealdean formations. In fact, we find
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>the Pterophyllum of the Keuper appear anew, with slight
specific differences in the Wealdean formations. The <em>equisetites</em>
of the Keuper extend to the mean oolithic formation;
the <em>baiera</em> of the Lias likewise recurs in the Wealdean beds
of the north of Germany; the Sagenopteris and the Camptopteris
likewise appear in the Keuper, Lias, and Oolite.</p>

<p>"Yet these common characters, which indicate a great
analogy between the Floras of each of these epochs of formation,
do not prevent each of them having characters of its
own, and often an assemblage of species, almost all peculiar
to each particular epoch. We ought, therefore, to distinguish
here those various subdivisions, the number of which
will perhaps be afterwards multiplied, when we become better
acquainted with the vegetables of each of the stages of the
Jurassic formations.</p>

<p>"<i>Keupric Epoch.</i>&mdash;M. Brongniart then gives an enumeration
of the vegetables of the Keupric epoch, which, in regard
to the Amphigenous cryptogams, consist of Algæ; in regard
to the Acrogenous cryptogams, of Ferns and Equisetaceæ; in
the case of the Gymnospermous dicotyledons of Cycadeæ and
Coniferæ; lastly, of two doubtful monocotyledons (<i>Palæoxyris</i>
and <i>Preisleria</i>.)</p>

<p>"On comparing this Flora with that of the variegated sandstone
of the Vosges, and with that of the Lias, we perceive
that it has nothing in common with the first except the palæoxyris,
which appears very nearly related to that of the variegated
sandstone; on the contrary, it resembles the Flora of
the Lias or Oolite in the ferns, many of which are specifically
identical, or nearly allied in the <i>Nilsonia</i> and <i>Pterophyllum</i>,
which are likewise either identical, or very nearly connected
specifically with the Lias.</p>

<p>"<i>Lias Epoch.</i>&mdash;The Liasic epoch furnishes Amphigenous
cryptogams, consisting of Algæ, mushrooms, and lichens;
Acrogenous cryptogams, such as Ferns, Marsileaceæ, Lycopodiaceæ,
and Equisetaceæ; Gymnospermous dicotyledons,
represented by the Cycadeæ and Coniferæ; finally, doubtful
monocotyledons, consisting of <i>Proacites</i> and <i>Cyperites</i>.</p>

<p>"The essential characters of this epoch are therefore, <i>1st</i>,
The great predominance of Cycadeæ, already well established,
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>and the presence of numerous genera in this family, particularly
<i>Zamites</i> and <i>Nilsonia</i>; <i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>, The existence of many
genera among the ferns with reticulated nerves, which
scarcely shew themselves, and under forms not greatly varied,
in the most ancient formations; but some of which, notwithstanding,
already begin to appear in the epoch of the Keuper.
Such are the <i>Camptopteris</i> and <i>Thaumatopteris</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Oolitic Epoch.</i>&mdash;The Oolitic epoch furnishes, among Amphigenous
cryptogams, the Algæ; among the Acrogenous
cryptogams, Ferns, Marsileaceæ, Lycopodiaceæ, and Equisetaceæ;
among the Gymnospermous dicotyledons, Cycadeæ
and Coniferæ; lastly, among the doubtful monocotyledons,
Podocarya and Carpolithes.</p>

<p>"This list is chiefly founded on the fossils, so varied in character,
collected on the coasts of Yorkshire, near Whitby
and Scarborough, in beds which are referred to different parts
of the inferior oolite, and particularly to the great oolite. It
likewise contains a small number of species found in the slaty
limestone of Stonesfield, near Oxford, depending on these
same beds.</p>

<p>"In France, the fossils of this formation have been collected
in the neighbourhood of Morestel, near Lyon, by Dr Lortet;
at Orbagnoux and Abergemens, near Nantua, in the department
of the Ain, by M. Itier; in the vicinity of Chateauroux,
near Châtillon-sur-Seine, by Colonel Moret; at Mamers, in
the department of Sarthe, by M. Desnoyers; and, lastly, in
the greatest quantity by M. Moreau, in beds of oolithic limestone
of a very pure white, in the neighbourhood of Verdun,
and near Vaucouleurs. Some species have likewise been
found at other points of the Jura, in Normandy, near Valogne,
in the neighbourhood of Alençon, in each of these localities
in very small number. But the greater part of these species
are not yet described and figured, and they generally differ
as species from those of England. The ferns are generally
less numerous, and not so well preserved; we must, however,
except the <i>Hymenophyllites macrophyllus</i>, found in a
perfect state at Morestel, and likewise observed at Stonesfield,
and in Germany. The Cycadeæ, the species of which
are not greatly varied, are referrible to the genera <i>Otozamites</i>
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>and <i>Zamites</i>; Ctenis, Pterophyllum, and Nilsonia have not
yet been observed; lastly, the Coniferæ of the genus <i>Brachyphyllum</i>
are there particularly abundant, and more frequent
than in the other localities.</p>

<p>"In Germany, it is more especially in the slaty limestone of
Solenhofen, near Aichstædt, that these fossils have been
observed, and particularly those of the family of Algæ. M.
Gæppert likewise notices many Cycadeæ in the Jurassic formation
of Ludwigsdorf, near Kreuzburg, in Silesia.</p>

<p>"But these localities, so diverse, are referrible to very different
stages of the Oolithic series, and perhaps will constitute,
when they are better known, and more fully explored, distinct
epochs.</p>

<p>"The distinctive characters of this epoch, comprising the
whole extent we have assigned to it, from the Lias to the
Wealdean formation exclusively, are; among the Ferns, the
rarity of ferns with reticulated nervures, so numerous in the
Lias; among the Cycadeæ, the frequency of <i>Otozamites</i> and
<i>Zamites</i>, properly so called; that is to say, Cycadeæ most
analogous to those of the existing period, and the diminution
of <i>Ctenis</i>, <i>Pterophyllum</i>, and <i>Nilsonia</i>, genera much more remote
from living species; finally, the greater frequency of
Coniferæ, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, <i>Brachyphyllum</i> and <i>Thuites</i>, much rarer in the
Lias.</p>

<p>"<i>Wealdean Epoch.</i>&mdash;This epoch affords, Amphigenous
cryptogams, the Algæ; among Acrogenous cryptogams,
Ferns, <i>Marsileaceæ</i>, and <i>Equisetaceæ</i>; among Gymnospermous
dicotyledons, <i>Cycadeæ</i> and <i>Coniferæ</i>; lastly, some Carpolithes
as plants of a doubtful class.</p>

<p><q>This enumeration results principally from discoveries
made, in recent years, in the Wealdean formations of the north
of Germany, at Osterwald, Schaumberg, Buckeburg, Oberkirke,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, of which the fossil plants were first described by M.
Ræmer, and afterwards in a more complete manner by M.
Dunker, in his monograph of these formations. To these
species must be added others, less numerous and varied, previously
discovered in the <i>Wealds</i> of England, near Tilgate
Forest, and Hastings in Sussex, and which are so well described
by M. Mantell.</q></p>

<p><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>This same formation has likewise been found in France,
near Beauvais, by M. Graves, who observed there <i>Lonchopteris
Mantelli</i>, and some other plants, of which M. Brongniart
has not seen specimens, and which he quotes from Graves on
the geology of the department of the Oise.</p>

<p>"These species, 61 in number, enumerated above, appear
to be all peculiar to this formation, with the exception, perhaps,
of <i>Baiera Huttoni</i>, which seems to be identical with the
species of the Bayreuth Lias and Scarborough Lias; but
their generic forms are almost all the same as those of the
Lias and Oolitic formations. The Cycadeæ, however, already
appear less numerous relatively to the ferns.</p>

<p>"We further observe, that this fresh-water formation, which,
according to our view, terminates the reign of the Gymnosperms
is connected, by the whole of its characters with other
epochs of the vegetation of the Jurassic formation, and is
distinguished from the Cretaceous epoch, which succeeds it,
by the complete absence of every species which could be
arranged among the Angiospermous dicotyledons, both in
France and England, as well as in the deposits of northern
Germany, so rich in varied species. On the contrary, in the
lower chalk, cretaceous <em>glauconia</em>, the quadersandstein or
planerkalk of Germany, we immediately find many kinds of
leaves evidently belonging to the great division of Angiospermous
dicotyledons, as well as some remains of palms, of
which no trace is observable in the Wealdean deposits.</p>

<p>"I class among the Cycadeæ the stems of the Tilgate forest,
formerly designated by the name of <i>Clatharia Lyellii</i>, and
which I have considered as a stem related to the <i>Dracæna</i>.
The whole of its characters, although the almost entire
absence of the tissues prevents us examining its anatomy,
appear to me to render this connection most probable, and
particularly to indicate the relations between this stem and
that of <i>Zamites gigas</i> found at Scarborough.</p>

<p>"The abundance of Lonchopteris Mantelli is a character of
the Wealdean formations of the south of England and the department
of the Oise, where this fossil seems to make its
appearance, at least in fragments, in the greater number of
localities, where these beds are exposed by the excavation of
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>potter's clay in this formation, near Savignies. In Germany,
on the contrary, this species is wanting, and <i>Abietites Linkii</i>
becomes the predominating plant. With regard to Brachyphyllum,
I have not yet had it in my power to study them in
a natural state; but the figures given of them leave little
doubt as to their analogy with the species of the Oolitic
epoch.</p>

<p>"The abundance of the Cycadeæ likewise forms a distinctive
character of the Wealdean formations of Germany. Still there
are, as has been seen, many species common to the two basins;
and I may add, that probably the Sphenopteris G&oelig;pperti,
<i>Dunk.</i>, does not differ from Sphenopteris Phillipsii, <i>Mant.</i></p>

<p>"I have not included in this list some marine plants mentioned
as belonging to the beds of this epoch; <i>1st</i>, because it
appears to me doubtful whether they really belong to the
Wealdean and not to the Glauconian epoch; <i><abbr title="secondly">2dly</abbr></i>, because it
still appears to me uncertain, whether the species mentioned,
Chondrites æqualis and intricatus, are quite identical, specifically
with the species of this name belonging to the fucoidal
sandstone lying above the chalk.</p>

<p>"<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <span class="sc">Reign of the Angiosperms.</span>&mdash;The dominating character
of this last transformation of the vegetation of the
globe, is the appearance of Angiospermous dicotyledons,
those vegetables which actually constitute more than three-fourths
of the vegetable creation of our epoch, and which
appear to have acquired this predominance from the commencement
of the Tertiary formations. For a long period I
was of opinion that these vegetables did not begin to appear
till after the chalk, with the earliest beds of the Tertiary formations;
but more recent investigation has shewn that beds
belonging to the Chalk formation present some very distinct
examples.</p>

<p>"These vegetables appear even at the beginning of the Chalk
formation; for it is certain that many well-determined species
exist in the quadersandstein and planerkalk of Germany,
which appear to correspond to the green sandstone of France,
or green sand of English geologists; although this formation
in France and England has never yielded any of them, but
only some examples of Cycadeæ, Coniferæ, and marine plants.
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>But in southern Sweden, at Kopingue in Scania, some specimens
of dicotyledonous leaves appear associated with a
species of Cycadeæ, in beds which have been referred to the
greensand; so that the whole Chalk formation would appear
to constitute a first period in the reign of the Angiosperms,
forming, so to speak, the passage between the vegetation of
the Secondary and that of the Tertiary formations, still presenting,
as the first, a few Cycadeæ, as the following, some
Angiospermous dicotyledons, and thus paving the way to the
considerable development of these vegetables in the succeeding
period. This period is besides characterised by many
Coniferæ peculiar to it, and which appear very distinct from
those of the Wealdean formations, and from those of the
Eocene epoch of the Tertiary formations; and such in particular
are the <i>Cunninghamites</i>.</p>

<p>"We can therefore distinguish two great periods in the
reign of the Angiosperms:</p>

<p>"<i>1st</i>, The Cretaceous period, a kind of period of transition.</p>

<p>"<i><abbr title="secondly">2dly</abbr></i>, The Tertiary period, presenting all the characters
arising from the predominance of Angiosperms, Dicotyledons,
and Monocotyledons, and divisible into many epochs,
the characters of which will not be well established until we
have removed all doubts as to the agreement of the different
local series of the Tertiary formations.</p>

<p>"<abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> <i>Cretaceous Period.</i>&mdash;The Cretaceous period, properly
so called, comprehends perhaps many distinct epochs; but the
beds where fossil vegetables have been observed, not having
been always classified with precision in the different subdivisions
of this formation, it is impossible to establish their
chronology with certainty. Besides, we must distinguish an
epoch which appears immediately to precede this formation,
and one which follows it, and yet differs from the Eocene
period.</p>

<p>"We are acquainted with fossil vegetables of the Cretaceous
period:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"<i>1st, Sub-Cretaceous Epoch</i>.&mdash;In the subcretaceous marine
lignites of the Isle of Aix, near La Rochelle, and of Pialpinson,
in the department of the Dordogne; these are the most ancient
beds of the Cretaceous formation, or the last of the
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>Jurassic period. Here have been found only marine plants,
wood, and branches of Coniferæ.</p>

<p>"<i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>, In the chloriteous chalk or greensand of southern
England, the neighbourhood of Beauvais and Maus; only
Cycadeæ and marine plants have been observed there.</p>

<p>"<i><abbr title="third">3d</abbr></i>, In the same formation in Scania, where M. Nilson
has observed leaves of Dicotyledons mixed with leaves of
Cycadites.</p>

<p>"<i>4th</i>, At Niedersch&oelig;na, near Freyberg, in Saxony, beds,
analogous to greensand or quadersandstein, containing fossils
of considerable variety, Cycadeæ, Coniferæ, and Dicotyledons,
particularly <i>Credneria</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>5th</i>, In the quadersandstein of Bohemia and Silesia, at
Blankenburg, at Teifenfurth, Teschen, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, where this sandstone
is characterised by the presence of dicotyledonous leaves
of the genus <i>Credneria</i>, by Cyeadeæ, and particularly by Coniferæ
of considerable variety, described by M. Corda in Reuss'
work on the Chalk of Bohemia.</p>

<p>"<i>6th</i>, In France, in the iron sands connected with the
green sandstones, near Grand-Pré, in the department of
Ardennes, where M. Buvignier has found two fossil vegetables
of a very remarkable character, a stalk of an arborescent
fern, and a cone previously observed in England in the same
formation.</p>

<p>"But in other places, and in beds belonging to epochs certainly
different, this period has presented only marine vegetables;
such more especially are those fucoidal sandstones
or macigno, characterised by Chondrites targionii, æqualis,
intricatus, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, now designated by the name of fucoidal sandstone
or flysch&mdash;the geological epoch of which has long been
doubtful, but which observers seem to agree in considering
as a distinct formation, superior to the chalk, and inferior to
the most ancient beds of the Tertiary formations.</p>

<p>"These fucoidal sandstones form a very distinct epoch,
which hitherto appears to be characterised only by marine
vegetables, and what, at least in a botanical point of view,
would form the line of demarcation between the Cretaceous
and Tertiary formations; for it is remarkable that the fuci
found there in such great numbers have little connection with
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span>those of the Chalk, properly so called, and none whatever with
those of the most ancient beds of the Tertiary formations,
such as those of Monte-Bolca.</p>

<p><q>From the study and comparison of these fossils, derived
from such various sources, we may divide the Cretaceous period
into three epochs, of which the middle one is the true Cretaceous
epoch. The others, characterised almost exclusively
by marine vegetables, are somewhat doubtful with regard
to their true geological position; the one, more ancient than
the Chalk, contains only the subcretaceous lignites of the
neighbourhood of La Rochelle, and the Department of Dordogne;
the other, superior to the Chalk, corresponds to the
Sandstone with fucoides.</q></p>

<p>The <em>subcretaceous</em> epoch comprehends Algæ, Naiadeæ,
and Coniferæ.</p>

<p>"This small Flora is almost entirely founded on fossil
plants, collected among the marine lignites of the Isle of Aix,
near La Rochelle, long since described by M. Fleureau de
Bellevue.</p>

<p>"The difference of the vegetables does not appear to admit
of connecting this Flora with that of the inferior chalk or
greensand; but it would require to be more completely examined,
both with regard to its precise geological epoch and
the entire amount of vegetable species which it contains.
The most abundant and characteristic of these species is the
<i>Rhodomelites strictus</i>, whose branches, crossed and mingled
with <i>Zosterites</i>, constitute the mass of these lignites with the
wood of Coniferæ, which have not yet been studied, and small
branchlets, very rare, of <i>Brachyphyllum orbignianum</i>.</p>

<p>"I have referred to this period the two <i>Cystoseirites</i>,<a name= "fnanchor_N35" id= "fnanchor_N35"></a><a href= "#footnote_N35" class= "fnanchor">[N35]</a> described
by M. de Sternberg, and mentioned by him as found
in the beds between the jurassic slates and the chalk in
Transylvania.</p>

<p><q>Does this fossil Flora correspond to a formation almost
entirely marine, but cotemporary with the Wealdean epoch?
New investigations can alone determine this, but we may
suppose an analogy between the Brachyphyllum of the
epochs.</q></p>

<p><i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>, <i>Cretaceous Epoch</i>.&mdash;The Cretaceous epoch presents us,
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>among the amphigenous cryptogams, with Algæ, some of which
are doubtful; among the Acrogenous cryptogams, with ferns;
the Monoctyledons are here represented by two species of
palms; the Gymnospermous dicotyledons by the cycadeæ and
coniferæ; the Angiospermous dicotyledons by a species of
Acerineæ, a betulaceæ, a cupulifera, salicineæ, an acerineæ, and
a juglandeæ; lastly, a few dicotyledons remain, but the determination
of the families to which they belong is uncertain.</p>

<p>"We ought, moreover, to notice at least from ten to twelve
species of dicotyledonous leaves, indeterminate, and often
imperfect, figured by Geinitz, Reuss, Corda, and G&oelig;ppert, or
existing in collections.</p>

<p>"This Flora, which contains from sixty to seventy species,
is, as we perceive, remarkable in this respect, that the Angiospermous
dicotyledons nearly equal the Gymnospermous dicotyledons,
and in the existence of a pretty considerable
number of well characterised Cycadeæ, which cease to appear
at the Eocene epoch of the Tertiary formations.</p>

<p>"The genus <i>Credneria</i>, containing dicotyledonous leaves,
with a very peculiar nervation, but the affinities of which are
doubtful, is likewise one of the characteristic forms of this
epoch, in a pretty considerable number of localities. With
regard to the species of dicotyledonous leaves, referred to
determined families, I may remark that these supposed relations,
founded on very imperfect specimens, and very few in
number, are still very uncertain, and incapable of furnishing
a basis for comparison with the other Floras, nor any certain
conclusion.</p>

<p>"<i><abbr title="third">3d</abbr></i>, <i>Fucoidian Epoch</i>.&mdash;This epoch, which seems to me to
form the most natural limit between the Cretaceous and Tertiary
periods, is characterised by those deposits, so rich in
Algæ, of a very peculiar form, that they have been called the
sandstones or macignos à fucoïdes, or the flysch of Switzerland,&mdash;a
formation very widely spread, especially in southern
Europe, from the Pyrenees, as far as the vicinity of Vienna,
and even to the Crimea.</p>

<p>"I have not hitherto found land plants mingled with these
marine species. I do not believe that fossil woods have been
met with.</p>

<p><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span><q>Almost all these Algæ appear to belong to the same group,
the genus <i>Chondrites</i>; and although the species are pretty
numerous, they pass from one to another by almost insensible
shades. The Algæ of the neighbourhood of Vienna, placed
in the genus <i>Munsteria</i>, are very ill characterised, and perhaps
are not congenerous with those of the jurassic limestone
of Solenhofen; but they appear to me to have been
found in the same formation, designated by the name of gray
calcareous slate, of the sandstone of Vienna, as the Chondrites
of the same country.</q></p>

<p>The Flora of the fucoidean sandstone is constituted by
twelve species of Algæ (<i>Chondrites</i> and <i>Munsteria</i>.)</p>

<p>"What is remarkable in this series of species is, that they
have nothing in common, either with the Algæ of the Subcretaceous
epoch, or with those of the Eocene epoch, and particularly
of Monte-Bolca, with which this Flora should be
almost cotemporary, according to many geologists. The identity
of these species of Algæ is likewise remarkable in all the
localities, however distant from each other&mdash;localities so numerous,
in regard to the greater number of these species,
that I have been unable to enumerate them.</p>

<p>"The Chondrites targionii, or perhaps a distinct species, but
very nearly related, is the only one presented in another formation,
in the greensand and gault of the Isle of Wight, in
England, according to M. Fitton; and in this same formation,
in the department of the Oise, according to M. Graves.</p>

<p>"M. Kurr has likewise described and figured, under the
name of <i>Chondrites bollensis</i>, a fucus of the Lias&mdash;the very
varied forms of which are almost identical with the Chondrites
targionii, æqualis, and difformis.</p>

<p>"<abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> <i>Tertiary Period.</i>&mdash;Considered as a whole, the vegetables
of this period, cotemporary with all the Tertiary deposits,
and continued even in the vegetation which now
covers the earth's surface, is one of the best characterised.
The abundance of Angiospermous dicotyledons, that of the
monocotyledons of diverse families, but especially the Palms,
during a part at least of this period, immediately distinguish
it from the most ancient periods. Yet the observations
made on the Cretaceous epoch have established a kind of
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>transition between the forms of the Secondary epochs and
those of the Tertiary epochs, which was not suspected a few
years ago. But while, at this period, the Angiosperms appear
nearly to equal the Gymnosperms, in the Tertiary period,
they greatly exceed them; while at the Cretaceous epoch,
there are still Cycadeæ and Coniferæ allied to the genera inhabiting
tropical regions; during the Tertiary period, the
Cycadeæ appear to have been completely wanting in Europe,
and the Coniferæ belong to the genera of the temperate regions.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding this assemblage of characters common
to the whole Tertiary period, there are evidently notable differences
in the generic and specific forms, and in the predominance
of certain families at different epochs of this long
period; but here we often experience serious difficulties in
establishing a uniformity as to time among the numerous
local formations which constitute the different Tertiary formations.
In assigning the different localities where fossil
vegetables have been observed to the principal divisions of
the Tertiary series, I have not followed exactly the bases admitted
by M. Unger in his Synopsis; I have approached
nearer to the distribution adopted by M. Raulin, in his Memoir
on the Transformations of the Flora of Central Europe
during the Tertiary period (<abbr lang="fr" title="Annales des Science Naturelles, tome 10">Ann. Sc. Nat., t. x.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 193, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr>
1848), which refers many of the formations, classified by M.
Unger in the Miocene division, to the Pliocene, or most recent
epoch. Yet, according to the advice of M. Elie de Beaumont,
I have not placed all the Lignite formations of Germany
in the Pliocene division, as M. Raulin has done, nor
all of them in the Miocene division, like M. Unger; but, conformably
to the old opinion of my father, I have left the
Lignites from the shores of the Baltic, which include amber,
in the inferior division of the old basins of Paris, London,
and Brussels, considering them cotemporary with the Soisson
Lignites. Those of the banks of the Rhine, of Wetteravia
and Westphalia, are arranged in the Miocene division;
those of Styria, and part of Bohemia, on the contrary, are
placed among the recent or Pliocene formations.</p>

<p>"This distribution agrees pretty generally with the nature
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>of the vegetables contained in them. One important point
only leaves me in doubt: this relates to the Lignites of the
environs of Frankfort or Wetteravia, the plants of which are
pretty generally analogous to those of &OElig;ningen or Partschlug
in Styria; although their geological position seems to
call upon us to refer them to a more ancient formation.</p>

<p>"It is probable that a more complete knowledge of these
diverse deposits would lead to a division into distinct epochs
more numerous; but I think that, in the meantime, the division
into three principal epochs, which I shall designate, with
the majority of geologists, by the names Eocene, Miocene,
and Pliocene, is sufficient for a comparison of the successive
changes of the vegetable kingdom. I shall point out for
each of them the localities which I think should be comprehended
under these different designations.</p>

<p>"With regard to the general characters which result from
the comparative examinations of these Floras, we find that the
number of species, in the great divisions, are thus distributed
in these three Floras:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"It may only be remarked that, in the first column, or Eocene
formation, the fossil fruits of the Isle of Sheppey&mdash;a part only
of which have been described by M. Bowerbank&mdash;have a great
influence on the numbers of the different divisions of Phanerogams,
and that this locality appears altogether exceptional,
and is, perhaps, an example of the effect of currents conveying
exotic fruits from remote climates, and accumulating them
on a point of the shores of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span>"In this point of view, the enumeration of the plants of this
first epoch is in no way comparable to that of the other
epochs, where I have refrained even from introducing the
small number of fossil plants from the Tertiary formations of
the equatorial regions that are known, in order to confine
myself to a comparison of the Tertiary Floras of Europe.</p>

<p>"With regard to the characters drawn from vegetable
forms during these three epochs, the most remarkable appear
to me, <i>1st</i>, In the Eocene period, the presence, but
rarity, of the palms, limited to a small number of species.</p>

<p>"The predominance of Algæ and marine Monocotyledons,
which must be ascribed to the great extent of marine formations
during this epoch.</p>

<p>"The existence of a great number of extra European forms,
resulting especially from the presence of the fossil fruits of
Sheppey.</p>

<p>"<i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>, In regard to the Miocene epoch, the abundance of palms
in the greater number of localities belonging, without doubt, to
this epoch; the existence of a considerable number of non-European
forms, in particular of the genus <i>Steinhauera</i>, which
appears to me to be a rubiaceæ allied to <em>nauclea</em>, found in
many localities of these formations.</p>

<p>"<i><abbr title="third">3d</abbr></i>, In regard to the Pliocene epoch, the great predominance
and variety of Dicotyledons, the rarity of Monocotyledons,
and, above all, the absence of Palms; lastly, the general
analogy of the forms of these plants with those of the temperate
regions of Europe, North America, and Japan.</p>

<p>"A remarkable character of the Floras of these three epochs,
but which is most striking in regard to the last, in which the
dicotyledonous plants are most numerous, is the absence of
the most numerous and characteristic families of the division
of Gamopetalis. Thus, among the numerous impressions of
Partschlug, &OElig;ningen, H&oelig;rring, Radoboj, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, there is nothing
to indicate the existence of the Compositæ, Campanulaceæ,
Personneæ, Labiaceæ, Solaniæ, Boraginaæ, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>"The only Monopetales mentioned in great numbers are the
Ericaceæ, Ilicineæ, some Sapotaceæ, and Styraceæ, families
which belong almost as much to the Dialypetales as to the
Gamopetales.</p>

<p><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>"In the Miocene flora only have been pointed out many
Apocyneæ, and Rubiaceæ, which I have mentioned above.</p>

<p>"1. <i>Eocene Epoch.</i>&mdash;This epoch, in the most precise limits,
comprehends plastic clay with its lignites, the coarse Parisian
limestone and gypsum which lie above it in the same basin;
but I have not thought it worth while, in the meantime, to
separate from it some formations which, according to the investigations
of modern geologists, are placed between the
Cretaceous formations and the inferior parts of the formations
mentioned; such are the Nummulitic formations of the Vicentin,
comprehending the celebrated locality of Monte-Bolca, and
probably some others near it, such as Salcedo, in the Vicentin.
I have likewise joined to this Flora of the Eocene formations
a very remarkable locality of the basin of Paris, the relations
of which with the Tertiary beds are not yet perfectly determined,&mdash;these
are the beds of a species of ancient Travertin
which, near Sezanne, contain numerous fossil vegetables still
undescribed, and of which I shall here notice the most remarkable.
These plants have very peculiar remains, and
belong probably to a special Flora, unless the differences can
be ascribed to a diversity of station.</p>

<p>"Besides the different members of the Eocene formation,
properly so called, of the Paris basin, I comprehend in this
Flora the fossils of the same formation in England, at the
Isle of Wight, and Isle of Sheppey in the London basin.
These latter fossils, consisting almost solely of fruits transformed
into pyrites, constitute a whole which has no analogue
in any other of the Tertiary basins of Europe; not only
in the number and diversity of these fruits, but in their peculiar
characters, which remove them widely from the plants
whose leaves occur in the other beds of the same geological
epoch. Everything, therefore, would lead us to suppose that
these fruits, although belonging to plants cotemporaneous
with the Eocene deposits of Europe, have been brought from
distant countries by marine currents, just as fruits are still
brought from the equatorial regions of America to the coasts
of Ireland or Norway by the great current of the Atlantic.
The deposit in the Isle of Sheppey appears therefore to be an
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>accidental case in the Eocene deposits, and the Paris basin
presents none of these fossils.</p>

<p>"The Tertiary basin of Belgium, which follows that of
London, has yielded, near Brussels, some fossil fruits in very
small numbers, but which appear identical with one of the
genera most abundant at Sheppey. This is the <i>Nipadites</i>,
considered at first as a species of Coco, under the name of
<i>Cocus burtini</i>.</p>

<p><q>Lastly, following the advice of my learned associate, M.
Elie de Beaumont, I have included in the same Flora the
plants contained in the Lignites of the shores of the Baltic
and Pomerania, so rich in amber, in which these vegetables
have often been preserved. It is to the labours of M. G&oelig;ppert
that we are indebted for a knowledge of these vegetables,
most frequently represented by very small fragments,
the relations of which he has determined with much skill and
accuracy.</q></p>

<p>With materials collected in these various localities, but of
which the greater part are still unpublished, we may construct
the Flora of the Eocene epoch; but the list, comprehending
only the species described, or at least determined, is
only a mere sketch.</p>

<p>M. Brongniart then gives the names of the vegetables
belonging to the Eocene epoch; these are, for the Amphigenous
cryptogams, algæ, and mushrooms; for the Acrogenous
cryptogams, hepatici, mosses, ferns, equisetaceæ, and
characeæ. The Monocotyledons present Naiades, Nipaceæ,
and palms. The Gymnospermous dicotyledons are represented
by Coniferæ (Cupressinæ, Abietineæ, Taxineæ, and
Gnetaceæ.) Lastly, among the Angiospermous dicotyledons,
we find examples of Betulaceæ, Cupuliferæ, Juglandeæ,
Ulmaceæ, Proteaceæ, Leguminosæ, &OElig;nothereæ, Cucurbitaceæ,
Sapindaceæ, Malvaceæ, Ericaceæ, and three doubtful
families (Phyllites, Antholithes, and Carpolithes.)</p>

<p>"The most remarkable characters of this Flora are,<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"<i>1st</i>, The great quantity of Algæ and marine Naiades,
characters owing to the extent and thickness of the marine
formations of this epoch.</p>

<p>"<i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>, The great number of Coniferæ, the greater part belonging
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>to genera still existing, but among which the Cupressineæ
appear to predominate, especially if we admit as positively
belonging to this family the various fruits of the Isle
of Sheppey, which M. Bowerbank has described under the
name of Cupressinites, and of which M. Endlicher has formed
the genera Callitrites, Frenelites, and Solenostrobus. If
these fruits really belong to European vegetation, they indicate
very peculiar generic forms, probably now wholly extinct.</p>

<p>"<i><abbr title="third">3d</abbr></i>, The existence of many large species of palm, equally
shewn by the occurrence of their leaves and stems.</p>

<p>"2. <i>Miocene Epoch.</i>&mdash;This Eocene or middle epoch of the
Tertiary formations appears to me to comprehend the following
localities among those which have furnished materials for
the study of the vegetation of the Tertiary period: <i>1st</i>, In the
environs of Paris, the superior sandstones, or those of Fontainebleau
and the <i>Meulieres</i>, or Buhrstone, which crown our coasts;
<i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>, The sandstone, with impressions, in the environs of Mans
and Angers, and probably those of Bergerac, in the department
of the Dordogne; <i><abbr title="third">3d</abbr></i>, A part of the Tertiary formations
of Auvergne, and particularly those of the mountain Gergovia,
formations which, by their impressions, appear more ancient
than those of Menat, but which perhaps all belong to different
stages of the Pliocene epoch; <i>4th</i>, The fresh-water formations
of Armissan, near Narbonne, the Gypsum of Aix in
Provence, the Lignites of Provence, whose vegetable fossils
are scarcely known; finally, the Lacustrine formations, rich
in the wood of palms, and in stems of Monocotyledons,
from Upper Provence, near Apt and Castellane; <i>5th</i>, A
part of the Tertiary formations of Italy, and particularly
those of Superga, near Turin; <i>6th</i>, The Mollasse of
Switzerland, with its Lignites, at Lausanne, K&oelig;pfnac, and
Horgen, containing the remains of palms; <i>7th</i>, The Lignites of
the banks of the Rhine near Cologne and Bonn, at Friesborf,
Liblar, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, sometimes enclosing wood of palms, and those of
Wetteravia at Nidda, near Frankfort, and other places; as
well as those of Weisner near Cassel, which all appear to be
of the same epoch, although those of Wetteravia, by the
abundance of certain genera of Dicotyledons, such as <i>juglans</i>
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>and <i>acer</i>, and even by many cases of specific identity, seem
to make a nearer approach to the Pliocene flora; <i>8th</i>, A part
of the Lignites of Bohemia, and particularly those of Altsattel,
whose fossils, described by M. de Sternberg and M. Rossmæssler,
generally agree with those of the other localities
already mentioned. The other Lignites of Bohemia, those
of Bilin and of Comothau in particular, enter completely
into the Pliocene flora; <i>9th</i>, H&oelig;rring in the Tyrol, and
Radoboj in Croatia, of which M. Unger has so well described
the numerous impressions in his <i>Chloris Protogæa</i>, and which
have almost become the type of the Miocene flora.</p>

<p>"With the exception of the Lignite formations of the neighbourhood
of Cassel and Frankfort&mdash;the species of which have
often numerous points of connection with those of &OElig;ningen
and Parschlug, and which enter rather into the Pliocene flora&mdash;the
different localities I have mentioned have numerous relations
between them as to their fossil vegetables. Thus, the
Nymphea Arethusæ is found in the <i lang="fr">Meulières</i> or Buhrstone
of Paris, and in the marls of Armissan; the Flabellaria rhapifolia
and maxima recur at H&oelig;ring in the Tyrol, at Radoboj
in Croatia, and in the superior sandstones of the environs of
Angers and Perigneux.</p>

<p>"The Callitrites Brongniartii, Endl., is likewise met with in
the formations of Armissan, Aix, in Provence, at H&oelig;ring and
Radoboj.</p>

<p>"Lastly, the Steinhauera globosa of the Altsattel Lignites
in Bohemia, is likewise found in the sandstone of the vicinity
of Maus; and the Platanus Hercules of Radoboj, in Croatia,
has been sent to me from Armissan, near Narbonne, by M.
Toumal.</p>

<p><q>These facts would probably multiply by a more attentive
study of the different localities; but as it is, they leave little
doubt as to the synchronism of the greater part of these local
formations.</q></p>

<p>In the Flora of the Miocene formations, Amphigenous
cryptogams occur, represented by Algæ and mushrooms; Acrogenous
cryptogams, represented by mosses, ferns, and Characeæ;
Monocotyledons, among which we find Naiades, Gramineæ,
Liliaceæ, and Palms; of the Gymnospermous dicotyledons,
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>Coniferæ; and Angiospermous dicotyledons, among
which occur Myriceæ, Betulineæ, Cupuliferæ, Ulmaceæ, Moreæ,
Plataneæ, Salicineæ, Lawrineæ, Umbelliferæ, Karolangeæ,
Combretaceæ, Calycantheæ, Leguminosæ, Anacardiæ,
Xanthoxyleæ, Juglandeæ, Rhamneæ, Acerineæ, Nympheaceæ,
Apocyneæ, and Rubiaceæ.</p>

<p>"The most striking characters of this epoch consist of the
mixture of exotic forms at present peculiar to regions warmer
than Europe, with vegetables growing generally in temperate
countries; such as the palms, a species of bamboo, Lawrineæ,
Combretaceæ, Leguminosæ of warm countries, Apocyneæ,
analogous, according to M. Unger, to the genera of equatorial
regions, a Rubiaceæ altogether tropical, united with
<em>erables</em>, walnuts, birches, elms, oaks, <em>charmes</em>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, genera
proper to temperate or cold regions. The presence of
equatorial forms, and particularly of palms, appears to
distinguish this epoch essentially from the following one.
Lastly, we likewise observe the very small number of vegetables
with a monopetalous corolla, limited to species referred
to the family of Apocyneæ by Unger, and to the genus
Steinhauera, founded on a fruit which has much relation to
that of Nauclea among the Rubiaceæ.</p>

<p>"3. <i>Pliocene Epoch.</i>&mdash;This epoch, embracing all the Tertiary
formations superior to the <i>fahluns</i> of Touraine, comprehends
pretty numerous localities rich in fossil vegetables, and whose
position in these formations is determined as much by the
<i lang="fr">ensemble</i> of the vegetables they contain, as by their other
geological characters. The Tertiary basins which, it appears
to me, must serve as the basis of this Flora, both by their
identity, and the numerous and carefully-studied vegetables
they contain, are: 1st, That of &OElig;ningen, near Shaffouse, the
species of which have been long since studied and well determined
by M. Alex. Braun, whose work, though unpublished,
has been communicated to many naturalists, and particularly
to M. Unger.<a name= "fnanchor_44" id= "fnanchor_44"></a><a href= "#footnote_44" class= "fnanchor">[44]</a> <i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>, That of Parschlug, in Styria,
the numerous impressions of which M. Unger has collected,
studied, and determined, partly published by him in his <i>Chloris
Protogæa</i>, and presented altogether in a special enumeration
of these species recently published under the title of
<i>Flora of Parschlug</i>. In this locality alone, M. Unger has
recognised and classified 140 different species; it is the most
numerous local Flora with which we are acquainted, and the
identity of a great number of species with those of &OElig;ningen,
indicates well the synchronism of these two local formations.
Such other points in Styria appear likewise to be of the same
epoch, as well as many localities in Hungary so rich in silicified
wood. In Bohemia, the tripoli slates of Bilin and Comothau,
which contain a pretty considerable number of plants
described by M. de Sternberg, are no doubt referrible to this
epoch, according to the nature of these plants. Lastly, the
Tertiary hills, called the sub-appennine hills of Plaisantin,
of Tuscany, and a part of Piedmont, as well as the gypseous
formation of Stradella, near Pavia, so rich in impressions of
leaves, form part of this epoch; but, with the exception of
this latter point, these formations contain, in general, few
vegetables.</p>

<p><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span>"In France, the Pliocene epoch probably comprehends a
part of the fresh-water deposits of Auvergne and Ardêche.
Thus, the slates of Menat and those of Rochesauve appear
to me to furnish a Flora very similar to those of &OElig;ningen
and Parschlug. With regard to the marls of Gergovia and
Merdogne, near Clermont, I think they ought rather to be
classed in the Miocene epoch; but this question can be
settled only by a more attentive determination of the species.
The Flora, which recapitulates all that has been described or
named in these formations, is, however, essentially founded,
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>as may be seen by the indication of localities, on the two
basins of Parschlug and &OElig;ningen.</p>

<p>"The Flora of the Pliocene formations is constituted by Amphigenous
cryptogams, comprehending algæ and mushrooms;
by Acrogenous cryptogams, including a muscite, ferns, lycopodiaceæ,
and equisitaceæ; by Monocotyledons, naiades,
gramineæ, cyperaceæ, and liliaceæ; by Gymnospermous dicotyledons,
coniferæ, represented by cupriessineæ, abietineæ,
and taxineæ; finally, by Angiospermous dicotyledons, comprehending
myriceæ, betulaceæ, cupuliferæ, ulmaceæ, balsamifluæ,
salicineæ, laurineæ, thymaleæ, santalaceæ, corneæ,
myrtaceæ, calycantheæ, pomaceæ, rosaceæ, amygdaleæ, leguminosæ,
anacardeæ, juglandeæ, rhamneæ, celastrineæ,
sapindaceæ, acerineæ, tiliaceæ, magnoliaceæ, capparideæ, sapoteæ,
styraceæ, oleaceæ, ebenaceæ, ilicineæ, and ericaceæ.</p>

<p>"The Pliocene epoch, considered in relation to Europe, for
I have intentionally excluded from the preceding list some
fossils of the Antilles referred to these formations, offers as
peculiar characters an extreme analogy to the existing Flora
of the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere; I do
not say of Europe, for this Pliocene flora comprehends many
genera strangers in the present time to Europe, but proper
to the vegetation of America or temperate Asia. Such are,
if we admit the accuracy of the generic relations established
by the botanists to whom these determinations are owing,
taxodium, salisburia, comptonia, liquidambar, nyssa, robinia,
gleditschia, bauhinia, cassia, acacia, rhus, juglans, ceanothus,
celastrus, sapindus, liriodendron, capparis, sideroxylon, achras,
and symplocos, all genera foreign to temperate Europe,
but in which they have been found in a fossil state, but which,
for the most part, still occur in the temperate regions of other
parts of the globe.</p>

<p>"As to other genera still existing in Europe, but which contain
only a small number of species, we find many more of
them in a fossil state; such are the <i>Erables</i>, of which 14
species are enumerated in this Flora of the Pliocene epoch,
and the Oaks, which are 13 in number. It ought to be remarked,
that these species come from two or three very circumscribed
localities which, in the present time, probably
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span>would not furnish, in a circuit of many leagues, more than
three or four species of these genera. Lastly, another character,
which I have already spoken of, and which makes this
Flora to differ still further from that of our epoch, is the absence,
or at least the small number and nature of the plants
with Gamopetalous corollas.</p>

<p>"Thus, there are only twenty plants of this Flora arranged
in the families of this division, and all are referrible to this
group of Hypogynous gamopetales, which I have distinguished
by the name of Isogynes; in the general organization of
the flowers, they approach nearest to the dialypetales.</p>

<p>"Is this absence of Anisogynous gamopetales, and with irregular
ovaries, the result of chance; or does it arise from this,
that many of these plants, particularly among the species of
temperate regions, are herbaceous, and that herbaceous
plants are generally in conditions less favourable for passing
into a fossil state? Or, lastly, did those families, which some
botanists have been led to consider the most elevated in organization,
not yet exist? These are points which cannot be
positively determined in the present state of our knowledge.</p>

<p>"We may however remark, that at the Miocene epoch,
these plants were still less numerous, but belonging to other
families; and that at the Eocene period, no one is mentioned
by the authors who have shewn the connection between the
fossil and living plants, without having any preconceived
idea on the subject.</p>

<p>"Another fact to be noticed, but which likewise probably
depends on the herbaceous nature of these vegetables, and
their leaves not being shed, is the almost complete absence
of Monocotyledons, ferns, and mosses, which establishes, in
regard to these families, a very great difference between
the Pliocene flora and that of modern Europe.</p>

<p>"A difference not less important distinguishes this Flora
from that of the most ancient epochs; namely, the absence, in
all these formations, of the family of Ferns, which, on the contrary,
furnishes so prominent a feature in the Miocene epoch.
No trace of them occur in Europe in the Pliocene formations
I have enumerated; while the woods of this family are very
abundant in the formations of the West Indies, which is considered
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span>as an epoch at least as recent as the Pliocene formation,
which appears to indicate that at this period the zones
of vegetation were distributed nearly as at present.</p>

<p>"Indeed, in these modern formations of the Antilles, we find
among the fossil woods, the only portions of their vegetables
that have hitherto been collected, specimens which indicate
the existence, not only of numerous and varied palms, but of
many other families of the equatorial zone, such as Lianes,
nearly related to Bauhinia and Menispermeæ, Pisonia, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
The vegetation of the Antilles had therefore at this period
the characters of the equatorial zone, as in Europe it had then
the characters of the temperate zone.</p>

<p class="moreafter"><q>Lastly, and to terminate our observations on this Flora of
the latter geological epoch which preceded the present one,
we would remark that, notwithstanding the general analogies
which exist between the vegetables of these formations and
those now living in the temperate regions, no species appears
to be identical, at least with the plants that still grow in
Europe; and if, in some rare cases, complete identity appears
to exist, it is between these vegetables and American
species. Thus the Flora of Europe, even at the most recent
geological epoch, was very different from the European Flora
of the present day.</q>&mdash;<i lang="fr">L'Institut.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_44" id="footnote_44"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_44">[44]</a>
The following interesting observations on the &OElig;ningen formation are by
Professor Agassiz, who refers it to the Miocene not to the Pliocene class:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;
mdash;</span>"This picture would be incomplete did I not institute a farther comparison
between the present vegetation of those regions and the fossil plants of modern
geological epochs. If we compare, namely, the Tertiary fossil plants of Europe
with those living on the spot now, we shall be struck with the differences of
about the same value as those already mentioned between the eastern and
western coasts of the continents under the same latitudes. Compare, for
instance, a list of the fossil trees and shrubs from &OElig;ningen, with a catalogue
of trees and shrubs of the eastern and western coasts, both of
Europe, Asia, and North America, and it will be seen that the differences
they exhibit scarcely go beyond those shewn by these different Floræ under the
same latitudes. But what is quite extraordinary and unexpected is the fact,
that the European fossil plants of that locality resemble more closely the trees
and shrubs which grow at present in the eastern parts of North America, than
those of any other part of the world; thus, allowing us to express correctly the
differences already mentioned between the vegetation of the eastern and western
coasts of the continents, by saying that the present eastern American flora, and
I may add, the fauna also,<a name= "fnanchor_A" id= "fnanchor_A"></a><a href= "#footnote_A" class= "fnanchor">[A]</a> and probably also that of eastern Asia, have a <em>more ancient
character</em> than those of Europe and of western North America. The plants,
especially the trees and shrubs growing in our days in this country and in
Japan, are, as it were, old fashioned; they bear the mark of former ages&mdash;a
peculiarity which agrees with the general aspect of North America; the geological
structure of which indicates that this region was a large continent long
before the extensive tracts of land had been lifted above the level of the sea in
any other part of the world.</p>

<p class="footnotecontinued">"The extraordinary analogy which exists between the present Flora and Fauna
of North America, and the fossils of the Miocene period in Europe, would also
give a valuable hint with respect to the mean annual temperature of that geological
period.</p>

<p class="footnotecontinued"><q><i>&OElig;ningen</i>, for instance, whose fossils of all classes have perhaps been more
fully studied than those of any other locality, could not have enjoyed, during
that period, a tropical or even a subtropical climate, such as has often been assigned
to it, if we can at all rely upon the indications of its Flora; for this is so
similar to that of Charleston, South Carolina, that the highest mean annual temperature
we can ascribe to the Miocene epoch in central Europe must be reduced
to about 60° Fah.; that is to say, we infer from its fossil vegetation that
&OElig;ningen had, during the Tertiary times, the climate of the warm temperate
zone, the climate of Rome, for instance, and not even that of the northern shores
of Africa. We are led to this conclusion by the following argument:&mdash;The
same isothermal line which passes at present through &OElig;ningen, at the 47th degree
of northern latitude, passes also through Boston, lat. 42°. Supposing now
(as the geological structure of the two continents and the form of their respective
outlines at that period seem to indicate), that the undulations of the isothermal
lines which we notice in our days existed already during the Tertiary period,
or, in other words, that the differences of temperature which exist between
the western shores of Europe and the eastern shores of North America, were
the same at that time as now, we shall obtain the mean annual temperature of
that age by adding simply the difference of mean annual temperature which
exists between Charleston and Boston (12° Fah.) to that of &OElig;ningen, which is
48° Fah., as modern &OElig;ningen agrees almost precisely with Boston, making it
60° Fah.; far from looking to the northern shores of Africa for an analogy,
which the different character of the respective vegetations would render still less
striking. The mean annual temperature of &OElig;ningen, during the Tertiary period,
would not therefore differ more from its present mean than that of Charleston
differs from that of Boston.</q>&mdash;<cite>Agassiz</cite>, <cite>on Lake Superior</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 150.</p>

<p class="p2">So much has been said and written within the last fifteen
years upon the dispersion of erratic boulders and drift, both
in Europe and America, that I should not venture to introduce
this subject again, if I were not conscious of having
essential additions to present to those interested in the investigation
of these subjects.</p>

<p>It will be remarked by all who have followed the discussions
respecting the transportation of loose materials over
great distances from the spot where they occurred primitively,
that the most minute and the most careful investigations
have been made by those geologists who have
attempted to establish a new theory of their transportation
by the agency of ice.</p>

<p>The part of those who claim currents as the cause of this
transportation has been more generally negative, inasmuch
as, satisfied with their views, they have generally been contented
simply to deny the new theory and its consequences,
rather than investigate anew the field upon which they had
founded their opinions. Without being taxed with partiality,
I may, at the outset, insist upon this difference in the part
taken by the two contending parties. For, since the publication
of Sefstroem's paper upon the drift of Sweden, in which
very valuable information is given respecting the phenomena
observed in that peninsula, and the additional data furnished
by De Verneuil and Murchison upon the same country and
the plains of Russia, the classical ground for erratic phenomena
has been left almost untouched by all except the advocates
of the glacial theory. I need only refer to the investigations
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>of M. de Charpentier, Escher, Von Derlinth and
Studer, and more particularly to those extensive and most
minute researches of Professor Guyot in Switzerland, without
speaking of my own and some contributions from visitors,&mdash;as
the Martins, James Forbes, and others, to justify my
assertion, that no important fact, respecting the loose materials
spread all over Switzerland, has been added by the
advocates of currents since the days of Sanssure, De Luc,
Escher and Von Buch; whilst Professor Guyot has most
conclusively shewn that the different erratic basins in Switzerland
are not only distinct from each other, as was already
known before, but that in each the loose materials are arranged
in well-determined regular order, shewing precise
relations to the centres of distribution, from which these
materials originated; an arrangement which agrees in every
particular with the arrangement of loose fragments upon the
surface of any glacier, but which no cause acting convulsively
could have produced.<a name= "fnanchor_46" id= "fnanchor_46"></a><a href= "#footnote_46" class= "fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The results of these investigations are plainly that the
boulders found at a distance from the Central Alps, originated
from their higher summits and valleys, and were carried down
at different successive periods in a regular manner, forming
uninterrupted walls and ridges, which can be traced from
their starting-point to their extreme peripheric distribution.</p>

<p>I have myself shewn that there are such centres of distribution
in Scotland, and England, and Ireland; and these facts
have been since traced in detail in various parts of the British
islands by Dr Buckland, Sir Charles Lyell, Mr Darwin, Mr
M'Laren, and Professor James Forbes, pointing clearly to
the main mountain groups as to so many distinct centres of
dispersion of these loose materials.</p>

<p>Similar phenomena have been shewn in the Pyrenees, in
the Black Forest, and in the Vosges, shewing beyond question,
that whatever might have been the cause of the dispersion of
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span>erratic boulders, there are several separate centres of their
distribution to be distinguished in Europe. But there is
another question connected with this local distribution of
boulders which requires particular investigation, the confusion
of which with the former has no doubt greatly contributed to
retard our real progress in understanding the general question
of the distribution of erratics.</p>

<p>It is well known that Northern Europe is strewed with
boulders, extending over European Russia, Poland, Northern
Germany, Holland, and Belgium. The origin of these boulders
is far north in Norway, Sweden, Lapland, and Liefland;
but they are now diffused over the extensive plains west
of the Ural Mountains. Their arrangement, however, is such
that they cannot be referred to one single point of origin,
but only in a general way to the northern tracts of land
which rise above the level of the sea in the arctic regions.
Whether these boulders were transported by the same agency
as those arising from distinct centres, on the main Continent
of Europe, has been the chief point of discussion. For my
own part, I have indeed no doubt that the extreme consequences
to which we are naturally carried by admitting that
ice was also the agent in transporting the northern erratics
to their present positions, has been the chief objection to the
view, that the Alpine boulders have been distributed by
glaciers.</p>

<p>It seemed easier to account for the distribution of the
northern erratics by currents; and this view appearing satisfactory
to those who supported it, they at once went further,
and opposed the glacial theory even in those districts where
the glaciers seemed to give a more natural and more satisfactory
explanation of the phenomena. To embrace the
whole question it should be ascertained:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, Whether the northern erratics were transported at
the same time as the local alpine boulders, and if not, which
of the phenomena preceded the other; and again, if the same
cause acted in both cases, or if one of the causes can be applied
to one series of these phenomena, and the other cause
to the other series. An investigation of the erratic phenomena
in North America seems to me likely to settle this
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>question, as the northern erratics occur here in an undisturbed
continuation over tracts of land far more extensive
than those in which they have been observed in Europe.
For my own part, I have already traced them from the eastern
shores of Nova Scotia, through New England and the north-western
States of North America and the Canadas as far as
the western extremity of Lake Superior, a region embracing
about thirty degrees of longitude. Here, as in Northern
Europe, the boulders evidently originated farther north than
their present location, and have been moved universally in a
main direction from south to north.</p>

<p>From data which are, however, rather incomplete, it can
be further admitted that similar phenomena occur further
west across the whole continent, everywhere presenting the
same relations. That is to say, everywhere pointing to the
north as to the region of the boulders, which generally disappear
about latitude 38°.</p>

<p>Without entering at present into a full discussion of any
theoretical views of the subject, it is plain that any theory,
to be satisfactory, should embrace both the extensive northern
phenomena in Europe and North America, and settle the
relation of these phenomena to the well-authenticated local
phenomena of Central Europe.</p>

<p>Whether America itself has its special local circumscribed
centres of distribution or not, remains to be seen. It seems,
however, from a few facts observed in the White Mountains,
that this chain, as well as the mountains of north-eastern
New York, have not been exclusively,&mdash;and for the whole
duration of the transportation of these materials,&mdash;under the
influence of the cause which has distributed the erratics
through such wide space over the continent of North America.
But, whether this be the case or not (and I trust local
investigations will soon settle the question), I maintain that
the cause which has transported these boulders in the American
continent, must have acted simultaneously over the
whole ground which these boulders cover, as they present
throughout the continent an uninterrupted sheet of loose
materials, of the same general nature, connected in the same
general manner, and evidently dispersed at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>Moreover, there is no ground, at present, to doubt the
simultaneous dispersion of the erratics over Northern Europe
and Northern America. So that the cause which transported
them, whatever it may be, must have acted simultaneously
over the whole tract of land west of the Ural Mountains, and
east of the Rocky Mountains, without assuming anything respecting
Northern Asia, which has not yet been studied in
this respect; that is to say, at the same time, over a space
embracing two hundred degrees of longitude.</p>

<p>Again, the action of this cause must have been such, and
I insist strongly upon this point, as a fundamental one, the
momentum with which it acted must have been such, that
after being set in motion in the north, with a power sufficient
to carry the large boulders which are found everywhere over
this vast extent of land, it vanished, or was stopped, after
reaching <em>the thirty-fifth degree of northern latitude</em>.</p>

<p>Now it is my deliberate opinion that natural philosophy
and mathematics may settle the question, whether a body of
water of sufficient extent to produce such phenomena can
be set in motion with sufficient velocity to move all these
boulders; and nevertheless stop before having swept over
the whole surface of the globe. Hydrographers are familiar
with the action of currents, with their speed, and with
the power with which they can act. They know also how
they are distributed over the globe. And, if we institute a
comparison, it will be seen that there is nowhere a current
running from the poles towards the lower latitudes, either in
the northern or southern hemisphere, covering a space equal
to one-tenth of the currents which should have existed to
carry the erratics into their present position. The widest
current is west of the Pacific, which runs parallel to the
equator, across the whole extent of that sea from east to
west, and the greatest width of which is scarcely fifty degrees.
This current, as a matter of course, establishes a
regular rotation between the waters flowing from the polar
regions towards lower latitudes.</p>

<p>The Gulf Stream, on the contrary, runs from west to east,
and dies out towards Europe and Africa, and is compensated
by the currents from Baffin's Bay and Spitzbergen emptying
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>into the Atlantic, while the current of the Pacific, moving
towards Asia, and carrying floods of water in that direction,
is maintained chiefly by antarctic currents, and those which
follow the western shore of America from Behring's Straits.
Wherever they are limited by continents, we see that the
waters of these currents, even when they extend over hundreds
of degrees of latitude, as the Gulf Stream does in its
whole course, are deflected where they cannot follow a
straight course.</p>

<p>Now, without appealing with more detail to the mechanical
conditions involved in this inquiry, I ask every unprejudiced
mind acquainted with the distribution of the northern
boulders, whether there was any geographical limitation to
the supposed northern current to cause it to leave the northern
erratics of Europe in such regular order, with a constant
bearing from north to south, and to form, on its southern
termination, a wide, regular zone from Asia to the western
shores of Europe, north of the fiftieth degree of latitude, before
it had reached the great barrier of the Alps? I ask,
whether there was such a barrier in the unlimited plains
which stretch from the Arctic seas uninterrupted over the
whole northern continent of America as far down as the Gulf
of Mexico?</p>

<p>I ask, again, why the erratics are circumscribed within the
northern limits of the temperate zone, if their transportation
is owing to the action of water currents? Does not, on the
contrary, this most surprising limit within the arctic and
northern temperate zones, and, in the same manner, within the
antarctic and southern temperate zones, distinctly shew that
the cause of transportation is connected with the temperature
or climate of the countries over which the phenomena were
produced? If it were otherwise, why are there no systems
of erratics with an east and west bearing, or in the main direction
of the most extensive currents flowing at present over
the surface of our globe?</p>

<p>It is a matter of fact, of undeniable fact, for which the
theory has to account, that, in the two hemispheres, the erratics
have direct reference to the polar regions, and are circumscribed
within the arctics and the colder part of the temperate
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>zones. This fact is as plain as the other fact, that the
local distribution of boulders has reference to high mountain
ranges, to groups of land raised above the level of the sea
into heights, the temperature of which is lower than the surrounding
plains. And what is still more astonishing, the
extent of the local boulders, from their centre of distribution,
reaches levels, the mean annual temperature of which corresponds,
in a surprising manner, with the mean annual temperature
of the southern limit of the northern erratics.</p>

<p>We have, therefore, in this agreement, a strong evidence
in favour of the view that both the phenomena of local mountain
erratics in Europe, and of northern erratics in Europe
and America, have probably been produced by the same
cause.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty is in conceiving the possibility of the
formation of a sheet of ice sufficiently large to carry the
northern erratics into their present limits of distribution;
but this difficulty is greatly removed when we can trace, as
in the Alps, the progress of the boulders under the same
aspect from the glaciers now existing, down into regions
where they no longer exist, but where the boulders and other
phenomena attending their transportation shew distinctly
that they once existed.</p>

<p>Without extending further this argumentation, I would call
the attention of the unprejudiced observer to the fact, that
those who advocate currents as the cause of the transportation
of erratics, have, up to this day, failed to shew, in a
single instance, that currents can produce all the different
phenomena connected with the transportation of the boulders
which are observed everywhere in the Alps, and which are
still daily produced there by the small glaciers yet in existence.
Never do we find that water leaves the boulders which
it carries along in regular walls of mixed materials; nor do
currents anywhere produce upon the hard rocks <i lang="la">in situ</i> the
peculiar grooves and scratches which we see everywhere
under the glacier and within the limits of their ordinary
oscillations.</p>

<p>Water may polish the rocks, but it nowhere leaves straight
scratches upon their surface; it may furrow them, but these
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span>furrows are sinuous, acting more powerfully upon the soft
parts of the rocks or fissures already existing; whilst glaciers
smooth and level uniformly the hardest parts equally
with the softest, and, like a hard file, rub to uniform continuous
surfaces the rocks upon which they move.</p>

<p>But now let us return to our special subject, the erratics
of North America.</p>

<p>The phenomena of drift are more complicated about Lake
Superior than I have seen them anywhere else; for, besides
the general phenomena which occur everywhere, there are
some peculiarities noticed which are to be ascribed to the
lake as such, and which we do not find in places where no
large sheet of water has been brought into contact with the
erratic phenomena. In the first place, we notice about
Lake Superior an extensive tract of polished, grooved and
scratched rocks, which present here the same uniform character
which they have everywhere. As there is so little
disposition, among so many otherwise intelligent geologists,
to perceive the facts as they are, whenever they bear upon
the question of drift, I cannot but repeat, what I have already
mentioned more than once, but what I have observed
again here over a tract of some fifteen hundred miles, that
the rocks are everywhere smoothed, rounded, grooved and
furrowed in a uniform direction. The heterogeneous materials
of which the rocks consist are cut to one continuous
uniform level, shewing plainly that no difference in the polish
and abrasion can be attributed to the greater or less resistance
on the part of the rocks, but that a continuous rush cut
down everything, adapting itself, however, to the general undulations
of the country, but nevertheless shewing, in this
close adaptation, a most remarkable continuity in its action.</p>

<p>That the power which produced these phenomena moved
in the main from north to south, is distinctly shewn by the
form of the hills, which present abrupt slopes, rough and
sharp corners towards the south, while they are all smoothed
off towards the north.</p>

<p>Indeed, here, as in Norway and Sweden, there is on all the
hills a lee-side and a strike-side. As has been observed in
Norway and Sweden, the polishing is very perfect in many
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>places, sometimes strictly as brilliant as a polished metallic
surface, and everywhere these surfaces are more or less
scratched and furrowed, and both scratches and furrows are
rectilinear, crossing each other under various angles; however,
never varying many points of the compass on the same
spot, but in general shewing that where there are deviations
from the most prominent direction, they are influenced by
the undulations of the soil. It has been said, that the main
direction of these striæ was from north-west to south-east,
but I have found it as often strictly from north to south, or
even from north-east to south-west; and if we are to express
a general result, we should say that the direction, assigned
by all our observations to the various scratches, tends to
shew that they have been formed under the influence of a
movement from north to south, varying more or less to the
east and west, according to local influences in the undulations
of the soil. It is, indeed, a very important fact, that
scratches which seem to have been produced at no great intervals
from each other, are not absolutely parallel, but may
diverge for ten, fifteen, or more degrees. There is one feature
in these phenomena, however, in which we never observe
any variation. The continuity of these lines is absolutely
the same everywhere. They are rectilinear and continuous,
and cannot be better compared than with the effects of stones
or other hard materials dragged in the same direction upon
flat or rolling surfaces; they form simple scratches extending
for yards in straight lines, or breaking off for a short
space to continue again in a straight line in the same direction,
just as if interrupted by a jerk. There are also deeper
scratches of the same kind, presenting the same phenomena,
only, perhaps, traceable for a greater distance than the finer
ones. These scratches, instead of appearing like the tracing
of diamonds upon glass, as the former do, would rather
assume the appearance of a deeper groove, made by the point
of a graver, or perhaps still more closely resemble the
scratches which a cart-wheel would produce upon polished
marble, if the wheel were chained, and coarse sand spread
over the floor. The appearance of the rock, crushed by the
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>moving mass, is especially distinct in limestone rocks, where
grooves are seldom nicely cut, but present the appearance of
a violent pressure combined with the grooving power, thus
giving to the groove a character which is quite peculiar, and
which at once strikes an observer who has been familiar with
its characteristic aspect. Now, I do not know upon what
the assertions of some geologists rest, that gravel, moved by
water under strong heavy currents, will produce similar
effects. Wherever I have gone since studying these phenomena,
I have looked for such cases, and have never yet found
modern gravel currents produce any thing more than a
smooth surface, with undulating furrows following the cracks
in the rocks, or following their softer parts; but continuous
straight lines, especially such crushed lines and straight furrows,
I have never seen.</p>

<p>When we know how extensive the action of water carrying
mud and gravel is on every shore and in every water-current,&mdash;when
we can trace this action almost everywhere,
and nowhere find it similar to the phenomena just described,
I cannot imagine upon what ground these phenomena are
still attributed to the agency of currents. This is the
less rational as we have at present, in all high mountain
chains of the temperate zone, other agents, the glaciers,
producing these very same phenomena, with precisely the
same characters, to which therefore a sound philosophy
should ascribe, at least conditionally, the northern and alpine
polished surfaces, and scratched and grooved rocks, or at
least acknowledge that the effect produced by the action of
glaciers more nearly resembles these erratic phenomena than
does that which results from the action of currents. But
such is the prejudice of many geologists, that those keen
faculties of distinction and generalization, that power of
superior perception and discrimination, which have led them
to make such brilliant discoveries in geology in general, seem
to abandon them at once as soon as they look at the erratics.
The objection made by a venerable geologist, that the cold
required to form and preserve such glaciers, for any length
of time, would freeze him to death, is as childish as the apprehension
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>that the heavy ocean-currents, the action of which
he sees everywhere, might have swept him away.<a name= "fnanchor_47" id= "fnanchor_47"></a><a href= "#footnote_47" class= "fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Now that these phenomena have been observed extensively,
we may derive also some instruction from the limits
of their geographical extent. Let us see, therefore, where
these polished, scratched, and furrowed rocks have been
observed.</p>

<p>In the first place they occur everywhere in the north
within certain limits of the arctics, and through the colder
parts of the temperate zone. They occur also in the southern
hemisphere, within parallel limits, but in the plains of the
tropics, and even in the warmer parts of the temperate zone
we find no trace of these phenomena, and nevertheless the
action of currents could not be less there, and could not at
any time have been less there than in the colder climates.
It is true, similar phenomena occur in Central Europe, and
have been noticed in Central Asia, and even in the Andes of
South America, but these always in higher regions, at definite
levels above the surface of the sea, everywhere indicating
a connection between their extent and the colder
temperature of the places over which they are traced.</p>

<p>More recently, a step towards the views I entertain of this
subject has been made by those geologists who would ascribe
them to the agency of icebergs. Here, as in my glacial
theory, ice is made the agent; floating ice is supposed to
have ground and polished the surfaces of rocks, while I consider
them to have been acted upon by terrestrial glaciers.
To settle this difference we have a test which is as irresistible
as the other arguments already introduced.</p>

<p>Let us investigate the mode of action, the mode of transportation
of icebergs, and let us examine whether this cause
is adequate to produce phenomena for which it is made to
account. As mentioned above, the polished surfaces are continuous
over hills, and in depressions of the soil, and the
scratches which run over such undulating surfaces are nevertheless
continuous in straight lines. If we imagine icebergs
moving upon shoals, no doubt they would scratch and polish
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>the rocks in a way similar to moving glaciers. But upon
such grounds they would sooner or later be stranded; and if
they remained loose enough to move, they would, in their
gyratory movements, produce curved lines, and mark the
spots where they had been stranded with particular indications
of their prolonged action. But nowhere upon arctic
ground do we find such indications. Everywhere the polished
and scratched surfaces are continuous in straight
juxtaposition.</p>

<p>Phenomena analogous to those produced by icebergs would
only be seen along the sea-shores; and if the theory of drifted
icebergs were correct, we should have, all over those continents
where erratic phenomena occur, indications of retreating
shores as far as the erratic phenomena are found. But
there is no such thing to be observed over the whole extent
of the North American continent, nor over Northern Europe
and Asia, as far as the northern erratics extend. From the
arctics to the southernmost limit of the erratic distribution,
we find nowhere the indications of the action of the sea as
directly connected with the production of the erratic phenomena.
And wherever the marine deposits rest upon the
polished surfaces of ground and scratched rocks, they can be
shewn to be deposits formed since the grooving and polishing
of the rocks, in consequence of the subsidence of those tracts
of land upon which such deposits occur.</p>

<p>Again, if we take for a moment into consideration the immense
extent of land covered by erratic phenomena, and view
them as produced by drifted icebergs, we must acknowledge
that the icebergs of the <em>present period</em> at least, are insufficient
to account for them, as they are limited to a narrower zone.
And to bring icebergs in any way within the extent which
would answer for the extent of the distribution of erratics,
we must assume that the northern ice-fields, from which
these icebergs could be detached and float southwards, were
much larger at the time they produced such extensive phenomena
than they are now. That is to say, we must assume
an ice period; and if we look into the circumstances, we shall
find that this ice period, to answer to the phenomena, should
be nothing less than an extensive cap of ice upon both poles.
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>This is the very theory which I advocate; and unless the advocates
of an iceberg-theory go to that length in their premises,
I venture to say, without fear of contradiction, that
they will find the source of their icebergs fall short of the
requisite conditions which they must assume, upon due consideration,
to account for the whole phenomena as they have
really been observed.</p>

<p>But without discussing any farther the theoretical views
of the question, let me describe more minutely the facts, as
observed on the northern shores of Lake Superior. The
polished surfaces, as such, are even, undulating, and terminate
always above the rough lee-side turned to the south,
unless upon gentle declivities, where the polished surfaces extend
in unbroken continuity upon the southern surfaces of the
hills, as well as upon their northern slopes. On their eastern
and western flanks, shallow valleys running east and west
are as uniformly polished as those which run north and south;
and this fact is more and more evident, wherever scratches
and furrows are also well preserved and distinctly seen, and
by their bearings we can ascertain most minutely, the direction
of the onward movement which produced the whole
phenomena. Nothing is more striking in this respect than
the valleys or depressions of the soil running east and west,
where we see the scratches crossing such undulations at right
angles, descending along the southern gentle slope of a hill,
traversing the flat bottom below, and rising again up the next
hill south, in unbroken continuity. Examples of the kind
can be seen everywhere in those narrow inlets, with shallow
waters intersecting the innumerable highlands along the
northern shores of Lake Superior, where the scratches and
furrows can be traced under water from one shore to the
other, and where they at times ascend steep hills, which they
cross at right angles along their northern slope, even when
the southern slope, not steeper in itself, faces the south with
rough escarpments.</p>

<p>The scratches and furrows, though generally running north
and south, and deviating slightly to the east and west, present,
in various places, remarkable anomalies, even in their
general course along the eastern shore of the lake. Between
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>Michipicotin and Sault St Marie, we more frequently see a
deflection to the west than a due north and south course,
which is rather normal along the northern shore proper, between
Michipicotin and other islands, and from the Pic to
Fort-William; the deep depression of the lake being no
doubt the cause of such a deviation, as large masses of ice
could accumulate in this extensive hollow cavity before spreading
again more uniformly beyond its limits. To the oscillations
of the whole mass in its southerly movement, according
to the inequalities of the surfaces, we must ascribe the
crossing of the straight lines at acute angles, as we observe
also at the present day under the glaciers, as they swell and
subside, and hence meet with higher and lower obstacles in
their irregular course between the Alpine valleys.</p>

<p>In deep, narrow chasms, however, we find now and then
greater deviations from the normal direction of the striæ,
where considerable masses of ice could accumulate, and move
between steep walls under a lateral pressure of the masses
moving onwards from the north. Such a chasm is seen between
Spar Island and the main land opposite Prince's Location,
south of Fort-William, where the furrows and scratches
run nearly east and west. But here also, there is no tumultuous
disturbance in the continuation of the phenomena, such
as would occur if icebergs were floated and stranded against
the southern barrier. The same continuity of even, polished
surfaces, with their scratches and furrows, prevails here as
elsewhere. The angles which these scratches form with each
other are very acute, generally not exceeding 10°; but at
times they diverge more, forming angles of 15°, 20°, and 25°.
In a few instances, I have even found localities where they
crossed each other at angles of no less than 30°; but these
are rare exceptions. It may sometimes be noticed that the
lines running in one direction form a system by themselves,
varying very little from strict parallelism with each other,
but crossing another system, more or less strongly marked,
of other lines equally parallel with each other. At other
times, a system of lines, strongly marked and diverging very
slightly, seem to pass over another system, in which the lines
form various angles with each other. Again, there are
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span>places,&mdash;and this is the most common case, where the lines
diverge slightly, following, however, generally one main direction,
which is crossed by fewer lines, forming more open
angles. These differences, no doubt, indicate various oscillations
in the movement of the mass which produced the lines,
and shew probably its successive action, with more or less
intensity, upon the same point at successive periods, in accordance
with the direction of the moving force at each interval.
The same variations within precisely the same limits
may be noticed in our day on the margin of the glaciers produced
by the increase or diminution of the bulk of their mass,
and the changes on the rate of their movement.</p>

<p>The loose materials which produced, in their onward
movement under the pressure of ice, such polishing and
grooving, consisted of various-sized boulders, pebbles, and
gravels, down to the most minute sand and loamy powder.
Accumulations of such materials are found everywhere upon
these smooth surfaces, and in their arrangement they present
everywhere the most striking contrast when compared with
deposits accumulated under the agency of water. Indeed,
we nowhere find this glacial drift regularly stratified, being
every where irregular accumulations of loose materials, scattered
at random without selection, the coarsest and most
minute particles being piled irregularly in larger or smaller
heaps, the greatest boulders standing sometimes uppermost,
or in the centre, or in any position among smaller pebbles
and impalpable powder.</p>

<p>And these materials themselves are scratched, polished
and furrowed, and the scratches and furrows are rectilinear
as upon the rocks <i lang="la">in situ</i> underneath, not bruised simply, as
the loose materials carried onward by currents or driven
against the shores by the tides, but regularly scratched, as
fragments of hard materials would be if they had been fastened
during their friction against each other, just as we observe
them upon the lower surface of glaciers where all the loose
materials are set in ice, as stones in their setting are pressed
and rubbed against underlying rocks. But the setting here
being simply ice, these loose materials, fast at one time and
moveable another, and fixed and loosened again, have rubbed
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>against the rock below in all possible positions; and hence,
not only their rounded form, but also their rectilinear grooving.
How such grooves could be produced under the action
of currents, I leave to the advocates of such a theory to shew;
as soon as they shall be prepared for it.</p>

<p>I should not omit here to mention a fact which, in my
opinion, has a great theoretical importance, namely, that in
the northern erratics, even the largest boulders, as far as I
know, are rounded, and scratched and polished; at least, all
those which are found beyond the immediate vicinity of the
higher mountain ranges, shewing that the accumulations of
ice which moved the northern erratics covered the whole
country; and this view is sustained by another set of facts
equally important, namely, that the highest ridges, the highest
rugged mountains, at least, in this continent and north of the
Alps in Europe, are as completely polished and smoothed as
the lower lands, and only a very few peaks seem to have
risen above the sheet of ice; whilst, in the Alps, the summits
of the mountains stand generally above these accumulations
of ice, and have supplied the surface of the glaciers with
large numbers of angular boulders, which have been carried
upon the back of glaciers to the lower valleys and adjacent
plains without losing their angular forms.</p>

<p>With respect to the irregular accumulation of drift-materials
in the north, I may add, that there is not only no indication
of stratification among them, such, unquestionably, as
water would have left, but that the very nature of these
materials shews plainly that they are of terrestrial origin;
for the mud which sticks between them adheres to all the
little roughnesses of the pebbles, fills them out, and has the
peculiar adhesive character of the mud ground under the
glaciers, and differing entirely in that respect from the
gravels, and pebbles, and sands washed by water-currents,
which leave each pebble clean, and never form adhering
masses, unless penetrated by an infiltration of limestone.</p>

<p>Another important fact respecting this glacial draft consists
in the universal absence of marine, as well as fresh-water
fossils in its interior&mdash;a fact which strengthens the
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span>view that they have been accumulated by the agency of strictly
terrestrial glaciers; such is, at least, the case everywhere
far from the sea-shore. But we may conclude that these
ancient glaciers reached, upon various points, the sea-shore
at the time of their greatest extension, just as they do at
present in Spitzbergen and other arctic shores; and that
therefore, in such proximity, phenomena of contact should
be observed, indicating the onward movement of glacial
material into the ocean, such as the accumulation within
these materials of marine fossil remains, and also the influence
of the tidal movements upon them. And now such is
really the case. Nearer the sea-shores we observe distinctly,
in some accumulations of the drift, faint indications of the
action of the tide, reaching the lower surface of glaciers, and
the remodelling to some extent of the materials which these
poured into the sea. A beautiful example of the kind may be
observed near Cambridge, along Charles River, not far from
Mount Auburn, where the unstratified glacial drift (<i>a</i>) presents
in its upper masses strictly the characters of true terrestrial
glacial accumulation, but shews underneath faint
indications (<i>b</i>) of the action of tides. Above, regular tidal
strata (<i>c</i>) are observed, formed probably after the masses
below had subsided. The surface of this accumulation is
covered with soil (<i>d</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>The period at which these phenomena took place cannot
be fully determined, nor is it easy to ascertain whether all
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span>glacial drift is contemporaneous. It would seem, however,
as if the extensive accumulation of drift all around the northern
pole in Europe, Asia, and America was of the same
age as the erratic of the Alps. The climatic circumstances
capable of accumulating such large masses of ice around the
north pole, having no doubt extended their influence over
the temperate zone, and probably produced, in high mountain
chains, as the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Black Forest, and the
Vosges, such accumulations of snow and ice as may have
produced the erratic phenomena of those districts. But extensive
changes must have taken place in the appearance of
the continents over which we trace erratic phenomena, since
we observe in the Old World, as well as in North America,
extensive stratified deposits containing fossils which rest
upon the erratics; and as we have all possible good reasons
and satisfactory evidence for admitting that the erratics
were transported by the agency of terrestrial glaciers, and
that, therefore, the tracts of land over which they occur stood
at that time above the level of the sea, we are led to the
conclusion that these continents have subsided since that
period below the level of the sea, and that over their inundated
portions, animal life has spread, remains of organized
beings have been accumulated, which are now found in a
fossil state in the deposits formed under those sheets of
water.</p>

<p>Such deposits occur at various levels in different parts of
North America. They have been noticed about Montreal, on
the shores of Lake Champlain, in Maine, and also in Sweden
and Russia; and what is most important, they are not everywhere
at the same absolute level above the surface of the
ocean, shewing that both the subsidence and the subsequent
upheaval which has again brought them above the level of
the sea, have been unequal; and that we should therefore
be very cautious in our inferences respecting both the continental
circumstances under which the ancient glaciers were
formed, and also the extent of the sea afterward, as compared
with its present limits.</p>

<p>The contrast between the unstratified drift and the subsequently
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>stratified deposits is so great, that they rest everywhere
unconformably upon each other, shewing distinctly
the difference of the agency under which they were accumulated.
This unconformable superposition of marine drift
upon glacial drift is so beautifully shewn at the above-mentioned
locality near Cambridge (see diagram, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 114.) In this
case the action of tides in the accumulation of the stratified
materials is plainly seen.</p>

<p>The various heights at which these stratified deposits occur,
above the level of the sea, shew plainly, that since their
accumulation the main land has been lifted above the ocean
at different rates in different parts of the country; and it
would be a most important investigation to have their absolute
level, in order more fully to ascertain the last changes
which our continents have undergone.</p>

<p>From the above mentioned facts, it must be at once obvious
that the various kinds of loose materials all over the
northern hemisphere, have been accumulated, not only under
different circumstances, but during long-continued subsequent
distinct periods, and that great changes have taken place
since their deposition, before the present state of things was
fully established.</p>

<p>To the first period,&mdash;the ice period, as I have called it,&mdash;belong
all the phenomena connected with the transportation
of erratic boulders, the polishing, scratching, and furrowing
of the rocks, and the accumulation of unstratified, scratched,
and loamy drift. During that period the mainland seems
to have been, to some extent at least, higher above the level
of the sea than now; as we observe, on the shores of Great
Britain, Norway, and Sweden, as well as on the eastern
shores of North America, the polished surfaces dipping under
the level of the ocean, which encroaches everywhere upon
the erratics proper, effaces the polished surfaces, and remodels
the glacial drift. During these periods, large terrestrial
animals lived upon both continents, the fossil remains of
which are found in the drift of Siberia, as well as of this
continent. A fossil elephant, recently discovered in Vermont,
adds to the resemblance, already pointed out, between the
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>northern drift of Europe and that of North America; for fossils
of that genus are now known to occur upon the northern-most
point of the western extremity of North America, in New
England, in Northern Europe, as well as all over Siberia.</p>

<p>To the second period we would refer the stratified deposits
resting upon drift, which indicate, that during their deposition
the northern continent had again extensively subsided
under the surface of the ocean.</p>

<p>During this period, animals, identical with those which
occur in the northern seas, spread widely over parts of the
globe which are now again above the level of the ocean.
But, as this last elevation seems to have been gradual, and is
even still going on in our day, there is no possibility of tracing
more precisely, at least for the present, the limit between
that epoch and the present state of things. Their continuity
seems almost demonstrated by the identity of fossil-shells
found in these stratified deposits, with those now living
along the present shores of the same continent, and by the
fact, that changes in the relative level between sea and mainland
are still going on in our day.</p>

<p class="moreafter">Indications of such relative changes between the level of
the waters and the land are also observed about Lake Superior.
And here they assume a very peculiar character, as
the level of the lake itself, in its relation to its shores, is extensively
changed.<a name= "fnanchor_48" id= "fnanchor_48"></a><a href= "#footnote_48" class= "fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The instrument which has been popularly named the
Water, or Marine Telescope, from the power given by its
use to see into the water, consists of a tube of metal or wood,
of a convenient length, to enable a person looking over the
gunnel of a boat to rest the head on the one end, while the
other is below the surface of the water; the upper end is so
formed, that the head may rest on it, both eyes seeing freely
into the tube. Into the lower end is fixed (water-tight) a
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>plate of glass, which, when used, is to be kept under the surface
of the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i129.png"
 width="250" height="340"
 alt="Illustration: Sketch of Marine Telescope"
 />
</div>

<p>A very convenient size for the instrument represented in the
above figure, is to make the length AC, 3 feet, and the mouth A,
where the face is applied, of an irregular oval form, that both
eyes may see freely into the tube, with an indentation on one
side, that the nose may breathe freely, not throwing the moisture
of the breath into the tube. B is a round plate of glass, 8
inches diameter, over which is the rim or edge C; this rim is
best formed of lead, ¼ of an inch thick, and 3 inches deep;
the weight of the lead serves to sink the tube a little into the
water. Holes must be provided at the junction of B to C,
for the purpose of allowing the air to escape, and bring the
water into contact with the glass; on each side there is a
handle for holding the instrument. This size and form is
very much that of the instrument brought from Norway by
John Mitchell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, Belgian Consul, of Mayville, with the
improvement for excluding the breath, and allowing the water
to get into contact with the glass, which was not provided
for in that instrument.</p>

<p>The reason why we so seldom see the bottom of the sea,
or of a pure lake, where the depth is not beyond the powers
of natural vision, is not that the rays of light reflected from
the objects at the bottom are so feeble as to be imperceptible
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span>to our sense, from their passage through the denser medium
of the water, but from the irregular refractions given to the
rays in passing out of the water into the air, caused by the
constant ripple or motion of the surface of the water, where
that refraction takes place. Reflections of light from the
surface also add to the difficulty; and before we can with any
just hope expect to see the objects distinctly at the bottom,
these obstructions must be removed.</p>

<p class="moreafter">This is done to a very great extent by the use of the instrument
which forms the subject of this notice; the tube
serves to screen the eyes from reflections, and the water
being in contact with the glass plate, all ripple is got rid of, so
that the spectator, looking down the tube, sees all objects at
the bottom, whose reflective powers are able to send off rays
of sufficient intensity to be impressed on the retina, after suffering
the loss of light caused by the absorbing power of the
water, which obeys certain fixed laws, proportionate to the
depth of water passed through; for as light passing through
pure sea-water loses half its intensity for each 15 feet through
which it passes,<a name= "fnanchor_49" id= "fnanchor_49"></a><a href= "#footnote_49" class= "fnanchor">[49]</a> we must, from this cause alone, at a certain
depth lose sight of objects of the brightest lustre. The perfect
purity of the water, and its freedom from all muddy
particles floating in it, form an important element in the
effective use of the water-telescope; for example, in the
Frith of Forth, and similar estuaries, where the influx and
reflux of the tide keep particles of mud in constant motion,
the instrument is of little or no use; for these act in
exactly the same way in limiting our vision through water,
as a fog does through the air: it is therefore only in the
pure waters of our northern and western shores that this
contrivance is applied with any advantage; and in such
situations we can speak of its powers with confidence.
In a trial made with the instrument last autumn on the
west coast of Scotland, the bottom was distinctly seen (a
white bottom) at a depth of 12 fathoms; and on a black,
rocky bottom, at 5 fathoms under water, objects were so distinctly
seen that the parts of a wreck were taken up&mdash;the
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>exact place of which was not known previous to its use. In
these experiments a lenticular form of glass was made use
of at the bottom of the tube, having a plane surface to the
water, but no great or marked advantage was observable from
this construction. With respect to the history of this contrivance
for viewing the bottom of the sea, we are unable to
assign any particular date: so far as our information goes, it
has been in use from a very remote period. We are informed
that it is in general use in seal-shooting along our northern
and western islands, where, sometimes in the form of an
ordinary washing-tub, with a piece of glass fixed in its bottom,
the shot-seal was looked for, and the grappling-hook
let down to bring him to the surface. It may not be generally
known, that in seal-shooting, the shot or wounded seal
always seeks the bottom, from which he never rises after
death, till washed ashore by the action of the sea: it is only
when the fatal ball deprives him of the power of diving that
he is ever found at the surface. In such employments, therefore,
the use of this instrument, however modified, must form
an important auxiliary to the best rifle. Throwing oil over
the surface of the water is used in the same pursuits; but this
only so far stills the ripple, leaving the reflections. Our
eminent engineer, Mr Robert Stevenson, made use of the
water-telescope more than 30 years ago, in works connected
with harbour improvement in the north of Scotland; it
has also been used to examine the sand-banks, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, at the
bottom of the River Tay, but in this case the mud prevented
its use in any considerable depth of water. To obviate this
difficulty, the construction was modified thus: by making
the tube of considerable length, and placing the glass at the
lower end, this tube was thrust through the water till within
a few feet of the bottom, acting as a cofferdam to set aside
the dirty water, and enable the bottom to be seen; but in
this method of application it was found very difficult to hold
the tube down in the water from its buoyant power, and we are
informed by Mr Thomas Stevenson, C. E., that, he understood
from this cause its use had been discontinued. He suggested
a simple remedy; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, to fill up the empty tube with
pure water. We are indebted to Mr Mitchell, the gentleman
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>already mentioned, for having brought this instrument
into notice in the public prints, under the name of Norwegian
water-telescope, on the shores of which country it
is stated to be much used in fishing&mdash;in particular, that of
the herring; but the herring-fishers on the east coast of
Scotland inform us, that they require no such auxiliary, as,
from the surrounding elevated grounds, they can tell the
position of the shoal, and, from their motions seen from such
situations, they know where they are to be found when they
go out a-fishing.<a name= "fnanchor_50" id= "fnanchor_50"></a><a href= "#footnote_50" class= "fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p class="footnotecontinued">The water-telescope is an instrument which the people of Norway have found
of so great utility, that there is scarcely a single fishing-boat without one of
three or four feet in length, which they carry in their boats with them when
they go a-fishing. When they reach the fishing-grounds, they immerse one end
of this telescope in the water, and look through the glass, which shews objects
some ten or fifteen fathoms deep as distinctly as if they were within a foot of
the surface. When a shoal of fish comes into their bays, the Norwegians instantly
prepare their nets, man their boats, and go out in pursuit. The first process
is minutely to survey the ground with their glasses, and where they find
the fish swarming about in great numbers, they give the signal, and surround
the fish with their large draught-nets, and often catch them in hundreds at a
time. Without these telescopes their business would often prove precarious
and unprofitable; as the fish, by these glasses, are as distinctly seen in the deep,
clear sea of Norway, as gold-fish in a crystal jar. This instrument is not only
used by the fishermen, but is also found aboard the navy and coasting-vessels
of Norway. When their anchors get into foul ground, or their cables warped
on a roadstead, they immediately apply the glass, and, guided by it, take steps
to put all to rights, which they could not do so well without the aid of the rude
and simple instrument, which the meanest fisherman can make up with his own
hands, without the aid of a craftsman. This instrument has been lately adopted
by the Scotch fishermen on the Tay, and, by its assistance, they have been
enabled to discover stones, holes, and uneven ground, over which their nets
travel, and have found the telescope answer to admiration, the minutest object
in twelve feet of water being as clearly seen as on the surface. We see no
reason why it could not be used with advantage in the rivers and bays of the
United States.</p>

which takes place in the Standard Points of Thermometers.</cite></h3>

<p class="center">By <span class="sc">John Adie</span>, <abbr class="spell">F.R.S.E., F.R.S.S.A.</abbr><br />Communicated by
the Author.</p>

<p class="p2">It has long been known to experimentalists that, in thermometers
constructed with the greatest care, a change takes
place after a lapse of time in the standard points, as given
by the melting of ice and boiling of water under a fixed pressure;
on this account it has been recommended by most
writers, where the employment of thermometers is treated
of, that they should from time to time be compared one with
another, and also at the freezing point. This change is a
rising of the mercury in the tube, so that, after a length of
time, the mercury will not sink to the point laid off in the
construction of the instrument. To investigate to what
cause this change was due, formed the object of my experiments:
Was it a change in the glass of which the bulbs
are formed, or in the mercury with which they are filled? I
was aware that thermometers filled with alcohol were not
subject to this change, which would lead to the inference,
that the change was in the mercury and not the glass; but
then, in the spirit-thermometer, air is left above the column
of spirit, whereas, in those constructed with mercury, the
air is expelled, and there is a vacuum above the column;
consequently, the bulb is pressed together with the force of
an atmosphere on all sides; might not this force, acting for
a length of time, cause some small alteration in the arrangement
of the particles forming the glass of the bulb?</p>

<p>This is the explanation accepted by most of the Italian
and French writers on this subject. Some suppose that the
mercury may contain air and moisture within its particles;
but such a hypothesis I think inadmissible, as in the case of a
vacuum over the mercury, these particles would seek the void,
and cause rather a depression than a rising of the freezing
point. Mr Daniell, in his Essay on Climate, adopts the same
view; and Sir John Herschel, in his article <q>Heat,</q> in the
Encyclopædia Metropolitana, says: <q>The freezing point upon
the mercurial thermometer has been supposed to undergo
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>some slight variation, so as to appear too low upon the scales
of those instruments which have been long made; and it is said
that, in such cases, the just indication was again recovered by
breaking off the end of the stem, so as to admit atmospheric
air.</q> But, as I had observed that the change went on for a
time only, after which it ceased, and that it affected thermometers
sealed with air over the mercury, as well as those
with a vacuum, I undertook the following experiments:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In September 1848 I made four thermometers having long
degrees,&mdash;such that 1/10° might be easily noted, constructed of
the same draft of glass tube; two of these I placed in boiling
water, and kept them at that temperature for a week: my
object in this was to learn if any change in the form of the
bulb would take place from this slow process of annealing, as
glass is known to undergo some change from such exposure.</p>

<p>The four thermometers were now filled with pure mercury:
two of these were sealed with a vacuum over the mercury;
one tube that had been boiled, and the other not: the
other two tubes were sealed with air over their columns, and
the freezing points of all were marked on the tubes; after
which they were placed in a window freely exposed to light,
where they were left till January 1849&mdash;a space of four
months&mdash;when they were again placed in melting ice, and
the freezing points marked; they had risen ·24°, ·24°, ·20°,
·06° parts of a degree. The whole four thermometers were
now placed in boiling water, and kept there for a week, when
the freezing points were again observed to have risen respectively
·48°, ·41°, ·50°, ·45°.</p>

<p>The instruments were now left exposed to light as at
first; and, in January 1850, the freezing points were again
observed, when they were found to have farther risen ·12°,
·18°, ·20°, ·13°; and, lastly, they were observed in May 1850,
when no change from last observation was notable.</p>

<p>The whole amount of rising of the freezing point in these
four thermometers, after a lapse of eighteen months, is respectively
·84°, ·83°, ·90°, ·65°; and these changes may be the
full amount that would take place were the instruments observed
after a greater lapse of time. From my experience,
I know that there is a period after which no change takes
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>place; but, from the method in which these experiments
have been conducted, I am not at present in a condition to
assign a time; moreover, it is evident that this period will
be much modified by circumstances. The results above
stated form the following Table:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

</table>

<p>From inspection of the Table, no very remarkable difference
is observable in the rising of these four instruments.
No. 4 appears to have risen less during the first period, but
goes along with the others afterwards. The effect of exposure
to the temperature of boiling water shews that, under
high temperature, the change goes on much faster than at
the ordinary temperature of the air; from the Table it will
be observed, that about twice the amount of change was
caused by the boiling of the thermometers for a week, than
had taken place between the first and second observations,
a period of four months.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the boiling of the thermometer
tubes for eight days, previous to their being filled with mercury,
had produced any change on the form of the bulbs; we
should at least infer this from the change in their freezing
points keeping pace so nearly with those which had not been
boiled.</p>

<p><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span>I now come to the concluding experiment with these instruments,
and, it appears to me most interesting and anomalous.
The four tubes being placed in pounded ice, the
columns stood at the points indicated in the last column of
the Table; in this situation the tops of the tubes were broken
off, so as to admit the free pressure of the air, and instantly
the thermometers fell, in the order of their numbers, ·54, ·43,
·40, ·35 of a degree, now indicating on their scales +·30,
+·40, +·50, +·35. The remarkable features shewn by this
experiment are; first, that the two thermometers sealed with
vacuum, and the two having air over their columns, should
have risen nearly equally, when two had their bulbs pressed
with the whole force of an atmosphere, while the other two
had no pressure externally, farther than that caused from
changes in the pressure of the atmosphere. Next, that on
being opened, those with air over them should have started
down nearly as much as those with a vacuum; and on all
these appears a permanent change from three to five-tenths
of a degree. I confess that I am very much at a loss to account
for these singular changes; atmospheric pressure on
the bulbs would account for the change in those sealed with
a vacuum; for we can easily suppose that a permanent form
had been taken from long exposure to that pressure by the
glass forming the bulbs: besides this permanent form, there
appears to have been a spring inwards, which instantly
sprung out on removal of the pressure by the admission of air
over the mercury; but the same reasoning will not apply to
the thermometers having air over the mercury; and before
I attempt to make any suggestions as to the cause of these
changes, I propose to institute the following experiments.
Having had three thermometers blown and filled with mercury,
I shall make one with a perfect vacuum over the mercury,
the next with air over it, and the third with air condensed
over it; and, noting the changes that may go on in
these, I hope to be able to assign a cause or causes for the
change. It is argued by some continental writers on this
subject that the reason why we do not perceive any change
in the freezing point in spirit-thermometers is from the great
expansion of spirit above mercury, volume for volume, thereby
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>requiring a much smaller mass of fluid to give the same
length of a degree: this I propose to test by making a thermometer
with the same size of tube and bulb as those to be
experimented on with mercury. In mentioning these experiments
to Professor Forbes, he kindly put me in possession of
some spirit-thermometers, one of these, made in 1837, having
a very large bulb&mdash;this, with three others, shewed no change
in the places of their freezing points.</p>

<cite>Observations on the Discovery, by</cite> Professor <span class="sc">Lepsius</span>, <cite>of Sculptured
Marks on Rocks in the Nile Valley in Nubia; indicating
that, within the historical period, the river had flowed at
a higher level than has been known in Modern Times</cite>.</h3>

<p class="p2">The recent archaeological<a name= "fnanchor_N7" id= "fnanchor_N7"></a><a href= "#footnote_N7" class= "fnanchor">[N7]</a> researches of Professor Lepsius in Egypt,
and the Valley of the Nile, in Nubia, have given a deserved celebrity
and authority to his name, among all who take an interest in the
early history of that remarkable portion of the Old World. While
examining the ruins of a fortress, and of two temples of high antiquity
at Semne, in Nubia, he discovered marks cut in the solid rocks, and
in the foundation-stones of the fortress, indicating that, at a very remote
period in the annals of the country, the Nile must have flowed
at a level considerably above the highest point which it has ever
reached during the greatest inundations in modern times. This remarkable
fact would possess much geological interest with respect
to any great river, but it does so especially in the case of the Nile.
Its annual inundations, and the uniformity in the periods of its rise
and fall, have been recorded with considerable accuracy for many
centuries; the solid matter held in suspension in its waters, slowly
deposited on the land overflowed, has been productive of changes in
the configuration of the country, not only in times long antecedent
to history, but throughout all history, down to the present day. Of
no other river on the earth's surface do we possess such or similar
records; and moreover, the Nile, and the changes it has produced
on the physical character of Egypt, are intimately associated with
the earliest records and traditions of the human race. Everything,
therefore, relating to the physical history of the Nile Valley must
always be an object of interest; but the discovery of Professor Lepsius
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>is one peculiarly deserving the attention of the geologist; for he
does not merely record the facts of the markings of the former high
level of the river, but he infers from these marks, that since the
reign of M&oelig;ris, about 2200 years before our era, the entire bed
of the Nile, in Lower Nubia, must have been excavated to a depth
of about 27 feet; and he further speculates as to the process by
which he believes the excavation to have been effected.</p>

<p>It will be convenient, before entering upon the observations I have
to offer upon the cause assigned by Professor Lepsius for the former
higher levels of the Nile indicated by these marks, that I should
give the description of the discovery itself, by translating Dr Lepsius's
own account of it, in letters which he addressed to his friends,
Professors Ehrenberg and Böckh of Berlin, from the island of Philæ,
in September 1844.<a name= "fnanchor_51" id= "fnanchor_51"></a><a href= "#footnote_51" class= "fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p class="blockquote">"You may probably remember, when travelling to Dongola on the
Lybian side of the Nile, and in passing through the district of Batn el
hagér, that one of the most considerable of the cataracts of the country
occurs near Semne, a very old fortress, with a handsome temple, built of
sandstone, in a good state of preservation; the track of the caravan
passing close to it, partly over the 4000-year-old artificial road. The
track on the eastern bank of the river is higher up, being carried through
the hills; and you must turn off from it at this point in order to see the
cataract. This Nile-pass, the narrowest with which I am acquainted,
according to the measurement of <abbr lang="de" title="Herr">Hr.</abbr> Erbkam, is 380 metres (1247 English
feet) broad;<a name= "fnanchor_52" id= "fnanchor_52"></a><a href= "#footnote_52" class= "fnanchor">[52]</a> and both in itself, and on account of the monuments
existing there, is one of the most interesting localities in the country, and
we passed twelve days in its examination.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The river is here confined between steep rocky cliffs on both sides,
whose summits are occupied by two fortresses of the most ancient and
most massive construction, distinguishable at once from the numerous
other forts, which, in the time of the Nubian power in this land of cliffs,
were erected on most of the larger islands, and on the hills commanding
the river. The cataract (or rapid) derives its name of Semne from that
of the higher of the two fortresses on the western bank; that on the
opposite bank, as well as a poor village lying somewhat south of it, is
called Kumme. In both fortresses the highest and best position is occupied
by a temple, built of huge blocks of sandstone, of two kinds, which
must have been brought from a great distance through the rapids; for,
southward, no sandstone is found nearer than Gebel Abir, in the neighbourhood
of Amara and the island of Sai (between 80 and 90 English
miles), and northward, there is none nearer than the great division of
the district at Wadi Haifa (30 miles distant.)</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Both temples were built in the time of Tutmosis <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, a king of the
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>18th dynasty, about 1600 years before Christ; but the fortresses in
which they stand are of a more ancient date. The foundations of these
are granite blocks of Cyclopian dimensions, resting on the rock, and
scarcely inferior to the rock itself in durability. They were erected by
the first conqueror of the country, King Sesuatesen <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, of the 12th
dynasty, in order to command the river, so easily done in so narrow a
gorge. The immediate successor of this king was Amenemha <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, the
M&oelig;ris of the Greeks: he who accomplished the gigantic work of forming
the artificial lake of M&oelig;ris, in the Fayoum, and from whose time&mdash;the
most flourishing of the whole of the old Egyptian kingdom&mdash;the risings
of the Nile in successive years, doubtless by means of regular markings,
as indeed Diodorus tells, remained so well known, that, according to
Herodotus, they were recorded in distinct numbers from the time of M&oelig;ris.
It appears that this provident king, occupied with great schemes for the
welfare of his country, considered it of great importance that the rising
of the Nile on the most southern border of his kingdom should be observed,
and the results forthwith communicated widely in other parts of
the land, to prepare the people for the inundations. The gorge at Semne
offered greater advantages for this object than any other point; because
the river was there securely confined by precipitous rocky cliffs on each
side. With the same view he had doubtless caused Nilometers to be
fixed at Assuan and other suitable places; for without a comparison
with these, the observations at Semne could be of little use.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The highest rise of the Nile in each year at Semne, was registered
by a mark, indicating the year of the king's reign, cut in the granite,
either on one of the blocks forming the foundation of the fortress, or on
the cliff, and particularly on the east or right bank, as best adapted for
the purpose. Of these markings eighteen still remain, thirteen of them
having been made in the reign of M&oelig;ris, and five in the time of his two
next successors. These last kings discontinued the observations; for, in
the meantime, the irruption of the Asiatic pastoral tribes into Lower
Egypt took place, and wellnigh brought the whole kingdom to ruin.
The record is almost always in the same terms, short and simple: <cite>Ra
en Hapi em renpe</cite> ... mouth or gate of the Nile in the year....
And then follows the year of the reign, and the name of the king. It
is written in a horizontal row of hieroglyphics, included within two lines&mdash;the
upper line indicating the particular height of the water, as is often
specially stated<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="blockquote">"The earliest date preserved is that of the sixth year of the king's
reign, and he reigned 42 years and some months. The next following
dates are, the years 9, 14, 15, 20, 22, 23, 24, 30, 32, 37, 40, 41, and
43; and include, therefore, under this king, a period of 37 years. Of the
remaining dates, that only of the 4th year of his two successors is available;
all the others, which are on the west or left bank of the river,
have been moved from their original place by the rapid floods which
have overthrown and carried forward vast masses of rock. One single
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>mark only, that of the 9th year of Amenemha, has been preserved in its
original place on one of the building stones, but somewhat below the
principal rapid.<a name= "fnanchor_53" id= "fnanchor_53"></a><a href= "#footnote_53" class= "fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p class="blockquote">"We have now to consider the relation which these&mdash;the most ancient
of all existing marks of the risings of the Nile&mdash;bear to the levels of the
river in our own time. We have here presented to us the remarkable
facts, that the highest of the records now legible; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, that of the 30th
year of the reign of Amenemha, according to exact measurements which
I made, is 8·17 metres (26 feet 8 inches) higher than the highest level
to which the Nile rises in years of the greatest floods; and further, that
the lowest mark, which is on the east bank, and indicated the 15th
year of the same king, is still 4·14 metres (13 feet 6½ inches); and the
single mark on the west bank, indicating the 9th year, is 2·77 metres
(9 feet) above the same highest level.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><q>The mean rise of the river, recorded by the marks on the east bank,
during the reign of M&oelig;ris, is 19·14 metres (62 feet 6 inches) above the
lowest level of the water in the present day, which, according to the
statements of the most experienced boatmen, does not change from year
to year, and therefore represents the actual level of the Nile, independently
of its increase by the falls of rain, in the mountains in which its
sources are situated. The mean rise above the lowest level, at the present
time, is 11·84 metres (38 feet 8 inches); and, therefore, in the time
of M&oelig;ris, or about 2200 years before Christ, the mean height of the
river, at the cataract or rapid of Semne, during the inundation, was
7·30 metres (23 feet 10 inches) above the mean level in the present
day.</q></p>

<p>Such are the facts recorded by Dr Lepsius; and then follow, in
the same letter, his views as to the cause of the remarkable lowering
of the level of the river.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><q>There is certainly no reason for believing,</q> he says, "that there has
been any diminution in the general volume of water coming from the
south. The great change in the level can, therefore, only be accounted
for by some changes in the land, and these must also have altered the
whole nature of the Nile Valley. There seems to be but one cause for
the very considerable lowering of the Nile; namely, the washing out and
excavations of the catacombs (<cite lang="de">Answaschen und Aushölen der Katakomben</cite>);
and this is quite possible from the nature of the rocks themselves,
which, it is true, are of a quality that could not well be rent
asunder, and carried away by the mere force of the water, but might
be acted upon directly by the rising of the water-level, and the consequent
effects of the sun and air on the places left dry, causing cracks,
into which earth and sand would penetrate, which would then give rise
to still greater rents, until, at last, the rocks would of themselves fall
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span>in, by having been hollowed out, a process that would be hastened in
those parts of the hills where softer and earthy beds existed, and which
would be more easily washed away. But that, in historical times, within
a period of about 4000 years, so great an alteration should take place in
the hardest rocks, is a fact of the most remarkable kind,&mdash;one which may
afford ground for many other important considerations.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"The elevation of the water-level at Semne must necessarily have affected
all the lands above; and, it is to be presumed, that the level of the
province of Dongola was at one time higher, as Semne cannot be the only
place in the long tract of cliffs where the bed of rock has been hollowed
out. It is to be conceived, therefore, that not only the widely-extended
tracts in Dongola, but those of all the higher country in Meroë, and as
far up as Fasogle, which, in the present day, are dry and barren on both
sides of the river, and are with difficulty irrigated by artificial contrivances,
must then have presented a very different aspect, when the Nile
overflowed them, and yearly deposited its fertile mud to the limits of the
sandy desert.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Lower Nubia also, between Wadi Haifa and Assuan, is now arid
almost throughout its whole extent. The present land of the valley,
which is only partly irrigated by water-wheels, is, on an average, from 6
to 12 feet higher than the level to which the Nile now rises; and although
the rise at Semne might have no immediate influence upon it, yet what
has occurred there makes it more than probable, that at Assuan there was
formerly a very different level of the river, and that the cataracts there,
even in the historical period, have been considerably worn down. The
continued impoverishment of Nubia is a proof of this. I have no manner
of doubt that the land in this lower part of the valley, which, as already
stated, is at present about 10 feet above the highest rise of the Nile, was
inundated by it within historical time. Many marks are also met with
here, that leave no doubt regarding the condition of the Nile Valley antecedent
to history, when the river must have risen much higher; for it has
left an alluvial soil in almost all the considerable bays, at an average
height of 10 metres (32 feet 9 inches) above the present mean rise of the
river. That alluvial soil, since that period, has doubtless been considerably
diminished in extent by the action of rain. On the 17th of August
<abbr lang="de" title="Herr">Hr.</abbr> Erbkam and I measured the nearest alluvial hillock in the neighbourhood
of Korusko, and found it 6·91 metres (22 feet 7 inches) above the
general level of the valley, and 10·26 metres (33 feet 7 inches) above the
present mean rise of the river. That rise, which at Semne, on account
of the greater confinement of the stream between the rocks, varies as much
as 2·40 metres (7 feet 10 inches) in different years, varies at Korusko less
than 1 metre (3 feet 3 inches).</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Near Abusimbel, on the west bank, I found the ground of the temple
6·50 metres (21 feet 2 inches) above the highest water-level. This temple, it
is well known, was built under Rameses the Great, between 1388 and 1322
years before Christ. Near Ibrim there are, on the east bank, four grottoes
excavated in the vertical rock that bounds the river, which belong partly to
the 18th and partly to the 19th dynasties; the last, under Rameses the Great,
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span>is also the lowest, and only 2·50 metres (8 feet 1 inch) above the highest
inundation; the next in height is 2·70 metres (8 feet 9½ inches) above the
former, and was made 250 years earlier, under Tutmes III. Although I
only measured the present level of the valley near Korusko, nevertheless
it appears to me that, during the whole of the new kingdom, that is, from
about 1700 years before Christ to this time, the Nile has not reached to
the full height of the low land of the valley.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><q>It is, however, conceivable that, at the time when the present low
land of the Nubian Valley was formed, the cataracts at Assuan were in a
totally different state; one that would, in some degree, justify the overcharged
descriptions of the ancients, according to whom they made so
great a noise that the dwellers near them became deaf. The damming up
of the inundation at Assuan could have no material influence on Egypt,
any more than that at Semne, or the land from thence to Assuan.</q></p>

<p>It appears therefore, from the above statements, that at the time
mentioned, the Nile, during the inundations, stood 26 feet 8 inches
higher than the highest level to which it now rises in years of the
greatest floods; and that, to account for this, Professor Lepsius conceives
that, between the time of M&oelig;sis and the present day, the bed
of the Nile, from a considerable distance above Semne to Assuan,
must have been worn down to that extent. In the index to the
volume of the Berlin Monatsbericht, in which the letters of Professor
Lepsius are inserted, there is the following line:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><q lang="de"><span class="sc">Nil</span>, <i>senkung seines Bettes um 25 Fuss seit 4000 Jahren</i>.</q></p>

<p class="blockquote"><q><i>Nile</i>, sinking of its bed about 25 feet (Paris) within the last 4000
years.</q></p>

<p>Rivers are, undoubtedly, among the most active agents of change
that are operating on the earth's surface; the solid matter which
renders their waters turbid, and which they unceasingly carry to the
sea, afford indisputable proof of this agency. But the power of
rivers to abrade and wear down the rocks over which they flow, and
to form and deepen their own bed, depends upon a variety of circumstances
not always taken into account; and although the great
extent of that power, in both respects, is shewn in the case of many
rivers, to conclude, as some have done, from these instances, that all
rivers have excavated the channels in which they flow, is a generalization
that cannot be safely assented to. The excavation of the
bed of a river is one of those problems in geological dynamics which
can only be rightly solved by each particular case being subjected to
the rigorous examination of the mathematician and the physicist.
The solid matter which rivers carry forward is in part only the produce
of their own abrading power; and the amount of it must be
proportional to that power, which is mainly dependent on their
velocity; they are the recipients of the waste of the adjoining lands
by other combined agencies, and the carriers of it to the lower districts
and to the sea. They often afford the strongest evidence of
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span>the vast lapse of time that must be included between the beginning
and close of a geological period; and, when they flow through
countries whose remote political history is known to us, they supply
a scale by which we may measure and estimate that lapse of time.
This is especially so in the case of the Nile.</p>

<p>When so startling an hypothesis as that now referred to, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, that
the entire bed of so vast a river as the Nile, for more than 250
miles, from Semne to Assuan, has been excavated, within historical
time, to a depth of 27 feet, is made by a person whose name carries
so much weight in one department of philosophical inquiry, the
statement involves such important geological considerations, that it
becomes the duty of the geologist to examine, and thoroughly test the
soundness of the explanation, in order that the authority of Professor
Lepsius, for the accuracy of the facts observed, may not be
too readily admitted as conclusive for the correctness of his theory of
the cause to which they owe their existence. That there has been
such an undoubting admission, appears from the following passage
in the work of one of the latest writers on Nubia:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><q>The translation of the name of this town (Aswán) is 'the opening;'
and a great opening this once was, before the Nile had changed its character
in Ethiopia, and when the more ancient races made this rock (at
the first cataract) their watch-tower on the frontier between Egypt and
the south. That the Nile has changed its character, south of the first
cataract, has been made clear by some recent examinations of the shores
and monuments of Nubia. Dr Lepsius has discovered water-marks so
high on the rocks and edifices, and so placed as to compel the conviction
that the bed of the Nile has sunk extraordinarily by some great natural
process, either of convulsion or wear. The apparent exaggerations of
some old writers about the cataracts at Syene may thus be in some measure
accounted for. If there really was once a cataract here, instead of
the rapids of the present day, there is some excuse for the reports given
from hearsay by Cicero and Seneca. Cicero says, that 'the river throws
itself headlong from the loftiest mountains, so that those who live nearest
are deprived of the sense of hearing, from the greatness of the noise.'
Seneca's account is: 'When some people were stationed there by the Persians,
their ears were so stunned with the constant roar, that it was found
necessary to remove them to a more quiet place.'</q><a name= "fnanchor_54" id= "fnanchor_54"></a><a href= "#footnote_54" class= "fnanchor">[54]</a>
</p>

<hr class="c10" />

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The learned author of an article on Egyptian Chronology
and History in the <q>Prospective Review</q> for May 1850, in referring
to the contributions of Professor Lepsius to Egyptian history,
says, <q>He has discovered undescribed pyramids, equal in number to
those known before; has traced the Labyrinth, and ascertained its
founder. <em>He has detected inscriptions on the banks of the Nile,
which show that its bed has subsided many feet in historic times.</em></q>
<i>9th June 1850</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span>In the assumption of an excavation of the bed of the river, we
have no small amount of wear to deal with, for the distance from
Semne to Assuan, following the course of the river, is not less than
250 miles; and if, as Professor Lepsius supposes, the excavation
extended to Meroë, we have a distance, between that place and
Assuan, of not less than 600 miles.</p>

<p>Although these records of a former high level of the Nile at
Semne had not been noticed by any traveller prior to Professor
Lepsius, we may rest fully assured of the accuracy of his statements,
from the habitual care and diligence, and the established character
for fidelity, of the observer. The silence of other travellers may be
readily accounted for by this, that none of them appear to have remained
more than a very short time at this spot&mdash;not even the diligent
Russegger&mdash;whereas we have seen that Professor Lepsius
passed twelve days in the examination of this gorge in the Nile
Valley.</p>

<p>The theory of a lowering of the bed of the river by wearing, involves
two main considerations, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the power of the stream, and
the degree of hardness of the rocks acted upon. The power depends
upon the volume and velocity of the river&mdash;the velocity on its
depth, and the degree of inclination of the bed: the hardness of the
rocks we can form a tolerable estimate of when we know their nature.
To judge, therefore, of the probability of the hypothesis of
Professor Lepsius, we must inquire into the physical and geological
features of the Nile Valley, in Nubia.</p>

<p class="moreafter">In the observations I have now to offer, my information has been
derived of course entirely from the works of other travellers, particularly
those of Burckhardt, Rüppell, and Russegger,<a name= "fnanchor_55" id= "fnanchor_55"></a><a href= "#footnote_55" class= "fnanchor">[55]</a> and especially
the latter, who travelled in Nubia in 1837; for he not only
enters far more into the details of the natural history of the country,
but he is the only traveller in Nubia who appears, from previous
acquirements, to have been competent to describe its natural history
with any degree of accuracy&mdash;I refer more particularly to the physical
and geological features of the country. Besides full descriptions
in his volumes, he has given a geological map of Nubia, and also
several sections, or what may more properly be called <em>vertical
sketches</em>&mdash;a term that would, perhaps, be a more appropriate designation
for all sections that are not drawn to a true scale, or at least
when the proportion of height to horizontal distance is not stated.</p>

<p>Ascending the river, we have, between Philæ and Korusko, a distance
of 24 German, or 115½ English miles, and without any rapid,
except one near Kalabsche. Korusko being 115 feet above the head
of the cataract of Assuan, at Philæ, we have an average fall of the
river between these two places of a foot in a mile.</p>

<p>Between Korusko and Wadi-Halfa there is no rapid. The distance
being 20 German, or 96⅓ English miles, and the difference of
altitude being 42½ feet, we have an average fall throughout that part
of the river's course of not more than 5·3 inches in a mile.</p>

<p>This very inconsiderable fall need not surprise us; for the average
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>fall of the Nile in Lower Egypt, at the lowest water, is little more
than one-third of that now stated. At the time of the highest water
the surface of the Nile, at Boulak, near Cairo; that is, about 116
miles in a direct line from the coast is only 43·437 English feet
above the level of the Mediterranean, and at the time of the lowest
water, only 17·33 feet. Thus, in the first case, there is an average
fall of about 5·00 inches; in the second, of not more than 1·80
inches in a mile.<a name= "fnanchor_59" id= "fnanchor_59"></a><a href= "#footnote_59" class= "fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Between Wadi Halfa and Dale, a distance of about 94 miles, six
cataracts, or schellals, as they are called in the language of the
country, are marked in Russegger's map. And here, it may
be as well to notice, that there are no cataracts, in the ordinary
sense of the term, on the Nile; no fall of the river over a precipice;
all the so-called cataracts are rapids, where the river
rushes through rocks in its bed; the rapids varying in their length
and degrees of inclination. We have no measurements of their
lengths or of their falls, except as regards the first and second cataracts.
The former, according to Russegger, has a fall of about 85
English feet in a distance of about 8 miles; and he describes the latter
as extending from 5 to 6 <i lang="de">stunden</i>; that is, from 12 to 14½ miles, but
he does not give the height. Speaking of the schellals above Semne,
Russegger says, that all may be passed in boats without difficulty
for about six weeks, or two months in the year. This is the case
also, at the cataract or rapid of Assuan. But between Wadi-Halfa
and Dale, with some inconsiderable spaces of free navigable water,
in the ordinary state of the river, there is an almost uninterrupted
series of rapids. We have no measurement of the height of Dale
above Wadi-Halfa, near to which the second great cataract of the
Nile occurs; but this is the part of the river's course where the fall
is greatest, and from Semne to Dale there are about 45 miles of this
more rapid fall.</p>

<p>From Dale to New Dongola, a distance of 35 German, or about
168 English miles, only three rapids are marked on Russegger's
map&mdash;the highest being at Hannek, about 26 English miles below
New Dongola. New Dongola being 806 English feet above
the sea, and the distance from that place to the rapid of Hannek
being 26 miles only, we may with probability estimate the surface
of the river at the rapid of Hannek at 780 feet above the sea. Now,
Wadi-Halfa being 522 feet, we have a difference of height, between
these two last-named places, of 258 feet; and the length of the
river's course between them being 236 miles, we have an average
fall of 13·12 inches in a mile; that is, in the part of the river's
course where nine rapids occur, in the provinces of Batn-el-Hadjar,
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>Sukkot, and Dar-el-Mahass, where the river flows over granite and
other plutonic rocks; gneiss, mica-schist, and other hard rocks, which
Russegger considers to be metamorphic. But between Semne and
the head of the second cataract at Wadi-Halfa, there is not a continuous
rapid stream; for Hoskins says, that about two miles above
that cataract, the river has a width of a third of a mile, and, when he
passed it the water was scarcely ruffled.<a name= "fnanchor_60" id= "fnanchor_60"></a><a href= "#footnote_60" class= "fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>From the rapid of Hannek to Abu Hammed, the distance is 329
English miles, and the difference of altitude is 246 English feet. We
have thus an average fall in that distance of 9·00 inches in a mile.</p>

<p>Thus, in the 776 miles between Abu Hammed and Philæ, we
have an average fall of the Nile</p>

<h4><i>Of the Breadth, Depth, and Velocity of the Nile, in Nubia.</i></h4>

<p>Our information is very scanty respecting the breadth and depth
of the river, either at the time of lowest water or during the inundations.
About two miles above Philæ, it is stated by Jomard<a name= "fnanchor_61" id= "fnanchor_61"></a><a href= "#footnote_61" class= "fnanchor">[61]</a> to
be 3000 metres, or nearly two English miles wide. At the second
cataract, or rapid of Wadi-Halfa, it spreads over a rocky bed of
nearly two miles and a-quarter in width (2000 klafter),<a name= "fnanchor_62" id= "fnanchor_62"></a><a href= "#footnote_62" class= "fnanchor">[62]</a> but contracts
above the rapid to a third of a mile. Russegger also states,
that the Nile, near Boulak, in Lower Egypt, is 2000 toises, nearly
two-and-a-half English miles in breadth, and yet that it is considerably
wider in some parts of Southern Nubia; but Burckhardt says,
that the bed of the Nile in Nubia is, in general, much narrower than
in any part of Egypt. Near Kalabsche, about 30 miles above
Philæ, the river runs through a gorge not more than 300 paces wide,
and its bed is full of granite blocks. It shortly afterwards again
widens for some distance; but near Sialla, 78 miles above Philæ, it
is contracted by the sandstone hills on both sides coming so near
each other, that the river's bed is again not more than from 250 to
300 paces wide. It is about 600 yards broad about two miles above
the second cataract near Wadi-Halfa, but is again very much contracted
in the rocky region of Batn-el-Hadjar. At Aulike it is only
200 paces broad.<a name= "fnanchor_63" id= "fnanchor_63"></a><a href= "#footnote_63" class= "fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>I have not met with any measurements of the depth of the river
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>in any part of its course in Nubia; but Hoskins describes it as being
so shallow at the island of Sais, 327 miles above Philæ, on the 9th
of June, which would be before the commencement of the inundation,
as only to reach the knees of the camels.<a name= "fnanchor_64" id= "fnanchor_64"></a><a href= "#footnote_64" class= "fnanchor">[64]</a> Near Derr, about
86 miles below the Cataract of Wadi-Halfa, Norden, in January,
found the river so shallow that loaded camels waded through it, and
his boat frequently struck the ground. In May, Burckhardt found
the river fordable at Kostamne, 53 miles above Philæ; and Parthey
states, that between Philæ and the island of Bageh, to the west of
it, the river is so shallow before the commencement of the inundation,
that it may be waded through.<a name= "fnanchor_65" id= "fnanchor_65"></a><a href= "#footnote_65" class= "fnanchor">[65]</a> Burckhardt says, that from
March to June the Nile-water, in Nubia, is quite limpid.<a name= "fnanchor_66" id= "fnanchor_66"></a><a href= "#footnote_66" class= "fnanchor">[66]</a> Miss
Martineau, who visited Nubia in December and January, speaking
of the river above Philæ says, that it <q>was divided into streamlets
and ponds by the black islets. Where it was overshadowed it was
dark-gray or deep blue, but when the light caught it rushing between
a wooded island and the shore, it was of the clearest green.</q><a name= "fnanchor_67" id= "fnanchor_67"></a><a href= "#footnote_67" class= "fnanchor">[67]</a> At
the second cataract she describes the river as <q>dashing and driving
among its thousand islets, and then gathering its thousand currents
into one, proceeds calmly in its course.</q><a name= "fnanchor_68" id= "fnanchor_68"></a><a href= "#footnote_68" class= "fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Although we have no accurate measurements of the velocity of
the Nile in Nubia, we may arrive at an approximate estimate of it
by comparing its fall with that of a river well known to us.</p>

<p>I have stated the fall of the Nile in different parts of its course
to be 5·30, 9·00, 12·00, and 13·12 inches in a mile. The fall of
the Thames from Wallingford to Teddington Lock, where the influence
of the tide ends, is as follows:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span><q>In general, the velocity may be estimated at from half-a-mile
to two miles and three-quarters per hour; but the mean velocity may
be reckoned at two miles per hour. In the year 1794, the late Mr
Rennie found the velocity of the Thames at Windsor two miles and
a half per hour.</q><a name= "fnanchor_69" id= "fnanchor_69"></a><a href= "#footnote_69" class= "fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the velocity of the Nile is probably
greatly inferior to that of the Thames; for it appears that, except
during the inundation, for more than half the year the depth is inconsiderable.
The average fall when greatest, that is, including the province
of Batn-el-Hadjar, where the rapids chiefly occur, is considerably
less than that of any part of the above course of the Thames; so that
there must be long intervals between the rapids where the fall must
be far less than 13 inches in a mile. The breadth of the Nile is
vastly greater; but supposing the depth of the water to be the same
as that of the Thames, on account of the friction of the bed, the
greater breadth would add very little to the velocity. If we assume
the average depth of the Thames in the above distance to be 5 feet,
and that it flows with an average velocity of 2 miles in an hour, and
if we assume the average depth of the Nile in that part of its course
where the fall is 13·12 inches to be 10 feet, when not swollen by
the rise, the velocity would be 2⅘ miles nearly in an hour,<a name= "fnanchor_70" id= "fnanchor_70"></a><a href= "#footnote_70" class= "fnanchor">[70]</a> if the
fall were equal to that of the Thames. We shall probably come near
the truth, by assuming the velocity of the Nile on this part at 2
miles in an hour. That it must be considerably less in the other
divisions of the course I have named, and especially in that part immediately
below the second cataract, where the average fall is only
5·30 inches for a distance of 96 miles, is quite evident.</p>

<p class="moreafter">The power of a river to abrade the soil over which it flows, so far
as water is by itself capable of doing so, must depend upon its
volume and velocity, and the degree of hardness of the material
acted upon. The power is increased when the water has force enough
to transport hard substances. But even transported gravel has little
action on the rocks with which it comes in contact, when it is free
to move in running water, unless the fall be considerable, and, consequently,
the velocity and force of the stream great. When stones
are firmly set in moving ice, they then acquire a great erosive power,
cutting and wearing down the rocks they are forcibly rubbed against;
but this condition never obtains in Lower Nubia, as ice is unknown
there.</p>

<h4><i>Geological Structure of Lower Nubia.</i></h4>

<p>One kind only of regularly stratified rock occurs in the 776 miles
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span>from Abu Hammed to Philæ; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> a silicious sandstone, similar to
that which occurs to a great extent on both sides of the Nile in
Upper Egypt, and which Russegger, after a very careful examination
of it there, considers to be an equivalent of the greensand of the cretaceous
rocks of Europe. The tertiary nummulite limestone, so
abundant in Egypt, has not hitherto been met with in Nubia.</p>

<p>The Nile flows over this sandstone for nearly 426 miles of the
entire distance, but not continuously. At Abu Hammed, it flows
over granitic rocks, and these continue from that place for about 120
miles. There is then about 215 miles of the sandstone, which is
succeeded by igneous and metamorphic rocks, that continue for 195
miles without any interruption, except a narrow stripe of sandstone
of about 15 miles near Amara. It is in this region of hard igneous
rocks that nearly all the rapids occur, between that of Hannek and
the great or second cataract at Wadi-Halfa. From the latter place
there is sandstone throughout a distance of about 196 miles, and then
commences the granitic region of the Cataract of Assuan, through
which the Nile flows about 35 miles. Thus we have about 350
miles of igneous and metamorphic<a name= "fnanchor_N8" id= "fnanchor_N8"></a><a href= "#footnote_N8" class= "fnanchor">[N8]</a> rocks, and about 426 of sandstone.</p>

<p>The general hard nature of the igneous and metamorphic rocks,
over which the Nile flows for about 155 miles above Semne, and for
about 40 immediately below it, will be recognised by my naming
some of the varieties described by Russegger, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> granites of various
kinds, often penetrated by greenstone dykes; sienite, diorite,
and felspar porphyries; gneiss, and clay slate, penetrated by numerous
quartz veins.</p>

<p>The siliceous sandstone is very uniform in its character; and in
Nubia, as in Egypt, the only organic bodies which it has as yet been
found to contain, are silicified stems of wood. Occasionally, as in
the neighbourhood of Korusko, interstratified beds of marly clay are
met with.<a name= "fnanchor_71" id= "fnanchor_71"></a><a href= "#footnote_71" class= "fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, we take into account the hard nature of the siliceous
sandstone, the durability of which is shewn by the very ancient
monuments of Egypt and Nubia, that are formed of it, and the still
greater hardness of the granites and other crystalline rocks, it is
manifest that the wearing action of a river flowing over so gentle a
fall, can scarcely be appreciable. If the occasional beds of marly
clay occur in the bank of the river, they may be washed out, and
blocks of the superincumbent sandstones may fall down; but such an
operation would have a tendency to raise rather than deepen the bed
of the river at those places; unless the transporting power of the
stream were far greater than can exist with so moderate a fall,
especially in that part of the river below Semne, where, for 96 miles,
it is not more than 5·3 inches, and for 115 miles below that, not
more than 12 inches in a mile. Even if we suppose the river to
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>have power to tear up its bed for some distance above Semne and
below it, as far as the rapid of Wadi-Halfa, it is evident that the
materials brought down would be deposited, except the finest particles,
in that tranquil run of 96 miles, which may be almost compared
to a canal. The drains in Lincolnshire are inclined 5 inches to a
mile.<a name= "fnanchor_72" id= "fnanchor_72"></a><a href= "#footnote_72" class= "fnanchor">[72]</a> When the annual inundations commence, the water of the
Nile comes down the rapid at Assuan of a reddish colour, loaded
with sand and mud only; whatever detrital matter of a larger and
heavier kind the Nile may have brought with it, is deposited before
it reaches that point.</p>

<p>From all these considerations, therefore, I come to the conclusion,
that the bed of the Nile cannot have been excavated, as Professor
Lepsius supposes, since the date of the sculptured marks on the rock
at Semne. He says, <q lang="de">Es lässt sich kaum eine andere Ursache für
das bedentende Fallen des Nils denken, als ein Answaschen und
Aushölen <i>der Katakomben</i>.</q> By the word <i>Katakomben</i> he can only
mean natural caverns in the rock; but such caverns are rarely, if
ever, met with in sandstones, and only occasionally in limestones. If
the course of the Nile were over limestone instead of sandstone,
we could not for a moment entertain the idea of a succession of
caverns for 200 miles beneath its bed, sometimes two miles in width,
the roofs of which were to fall in; and where the igneous rocks prevail,
this explanation is wholly inapplicable.</p>

<p>But besides the objections arising from the nature of the rocks,
and the inconsiderable fall of the river, there is still another difficulty
to overcome. It is to be borne in mind, that this lowering of the
bed of the Nile, from Semne to Assuan, is supposed to have taken
place within the last 4000 years. Between the first cataract at
Assuan and the second at Wadi-Halfa, there are numerous remains
of temples on both banks of the Nile, some of very great antiquity.
<q>From Wadi-Halfa to Philæ,</q> says Parthey, <q>there is a vast number
of Egyptian monuments, almost all on the left bank of the river,
and so near the water that most of them are in immediate contact
with it.</q><a name= "fnanchor_73" id= "fnanchor_73"></a><a href= "#footnote_73" class= "fnanchor">[73]</a> We may rest assured that the builders of these would
place them out of the reach of the highest inundations then known.
Although we have many accurate descriptions of these monuments,
the heights of their foundations above the surface of the river
are not often given; they are, however, mentioned in some instances.
I shall describe the situations of some of these buildings
relatively to the present state of the river's levels, and shall begin
with those on the island of Philæ.</p>

<p>This island, according to the measurements of General von Prokesh,
is 1200 Paris feet (1278 English) in length, and 420 (447)
in breadth, and is composed of granite. Lancrot informs us, that,
<q lang="fr">à l'époque des hautes eaux, l'île de Philæ est peu élevé audessus
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span>de leur surface, mais lorqu'elles sont abaissées elle les surpasse de
huit metres.</q> It was formerly surrounded by a quay of masonry,
portions of which may be traced at intervals, and in some places
they are still in good preservation. The south-west part of the
island is occupied by temples. According to Wilkinson, the principal
building is a temple of Isis commenced by Ptolemy Philadelphus,
who reigned from 283 to 247 years before Christ; and he adds,
that it is evident an ancient building formerly stood on the site of
the present great temple. Lancrot, in referring to this more ancient
building, says:&mdash;<q lang="fr">Il y a des preuves certaines d'une antiquité
bien plus reculeé encore, puisque des pierres qui entrent dans la construction
de ce même grand temple, sont des débris de quelque construction
antérieure.</q> Rossellini considers that it was built by Nectanabis.
The first king of Egypt, of the Sebennite dynasty of that
name, ascended the throne 374 years <span class="muchsmaller">B.C.</span>, the second and last ceased
to reign about 350 years <span class="muchsmaller">B.C.</span><a name= "fnanchor_74" id= "fnanchor_74"></a><a href= "#footnote_74" class= "fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Rossellini<a name= "fnanchor_75" id= "fnanchor_75"></a><a href= "#footnote_75" class= "fnanchor">[75]</a> informs us, that on the island of Bageh, opposite to
Philæ, there are the remains of a temple of the time of Amenophis
II., and a sitting statue of granite representing him. He was
a king in the earlier years of the 18th dynasty, which, according to
the Chevalier Bunsen,<a name= "fnanchor_76" id= "fnanchor_76"></a><a href= "#footnote_76" class= "fnanchor">[76]</a> began in the year 1638, and ended in 1410
<span class="muchsmaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Gau</span>,<a name= "fnanchor_77" id= "fnanchor_77"></a><a href= "#footnote_77" class= "fnanchor">[77]</a> in describing a temple at Debu, about 12 miles above
Philæ, which he visited in January, and consequently during the time
of low water, states that he discovered under the sand, at the edge of
the river, the remains of a terrace leading towards a temple.</p>

<p>A short distance north of Kalabsche, about 30 miles above Philæ,
at Beil-nalli, Rossellini<a name= "fnanchor_78" id= "fnanchor_78"></a><a href= "#footnote_78" class= "fnanchor">[78]</a> speaks of a small temple in the following
terms:&mdash;<q>Among the many memorials that still exist of Ramses II.,
the most important, in a historical point of view, is a small temple or
grotto excavated in the rock;</q> and Wilkinson mentions it <q>as a
small but interesting temple excavated in the rock, of the time of
Rameses II., whom Champellion supposes to be the father of Sesostris
or Rameses the Great.</q><a name= "fnanchor_79" id= "fnanchor_79"></a><a href= "#footnote_79" class= "fnanchor">[79]</a> He was the first king of the 19th
dynasty, which began in the year 1409 <span class="muchsmaller">B.C.</span><a name= "fnanchor_80" id= "fnanchor_80"></a><a href= "#footnote_80" class= "fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Gau<a name= "fnanchor_81" id= "fnanchor_81"></a><a href= "#footnote_81" class= "fnanchor">[81]</a> thus describes a monument at Gerbé Dandour:&mdash;<q lang="fr">La
chaine de montagnes qui borde le Nil est, dans cet endroit, si approchée
du lit de ce fleuve, qu'il ne reste que très peu d'espace sur
la rive. Cet espace est presque entièrement occupé par le monument,
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span>et la rivière, dans ses débordemens, arrive jusqu'au pied du mur de
la terrasse.</q></p>

<p>Parthey informs us that the temple of Sebua is about 200 feet
distant from the river, in which distance there are two rows of
sphinxes, and that the road between them, from the temple, ends in
wide steps at the water's edge; and he adds, that Champellion refers
this temple to the time of Rameses the Great.<a name= "fnanchor_82" id= "fnanchor_82"></a><a href= "#footnote_82" class= "fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>It thus appears that monuments exist close to the river, some of
which were constructed at least 1400 years before our era; so that
taking the time of Amenemha III. to be, as Professor Lepsius states,
2200 years <span class="muchsmaller">B.C.</span>, the excavation of the bed of the Nile which he supposes
to have taken place, must have been the work, not of 4000
years but of 800. If the erosive power of the river was so active
in that time, it cannot be supposed that it then ceased; it would
surely have continued to deepen the bed during the following 3000
years.</p>

<p>At all events, the buildings on the island of Philæ demonstrate
that the bed of the Nile must have been very much the same as it
is now, 2200 years ago; and even a thousand years earlier it must
have been the same, if the foundation of the temple on the island of
Begh, opposite to Philæ, be near the limit of the highest rise of the
Nile of the present time; so that there could be no barrier at the
Cataract of Assuan to dam up the Nile when they were constructed;
and thus the deafening sound of the waterfall recorded by Cicero and
Seneca must still be held to be an exaggeration.</p>

<p>The existence of alluvial soil, apparently of the same kind as that
deposited by the Nile, in situations above the Cataract of Assuan,
at a level considerably above the highest point which the inundations
of the river have reached in modern times, to which allusion is
made by Professor Lepsius, has been noticed by other travellers,
and even at still higher levels than those he mentions. Whether
that alluvial soil be identical with, or only resembles the Nile deposit,
would require to be determined by a close examination, and
especially with regard to organic remains, if any can be found in it.
There is no evidence to shew that it was deposited during the historical
period, and it may be an evidence of a depression and subsequent
elevation of the land antecedent to that period. It may not be of
fresh-water origin, but the clay and sand, or till, left by a drift while
the land was under the sea. For remote as is the antiquity of Nubia
and Egypt, in relation to the existence of the human race, it appears
to be of very modern formation in geological time. The greater
part of Lower Egypt, probably all the Delta, is of post-pliocene age,
and even late in that age; and the very granite of the Cataract of
Assuan, that of which the oldest monuments in Egypt are formed,
and which, in the earlier days of geology, was looked upon as the
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>very type of the rock on which the oldest strata of the earth were
founded, is said to have burst forth during the later tertiary period.
We learn from Russegger, that the low land which lies between the
Mediterranean and the range of hills that extends from Cairo to the
Red Sea at Suez, and of which hills a nummulite limestone constitutes
a great part, is composed of a sandstone which he calls a
<q>Meeresdiluvium,</q> a marine diluvial formation, and considers to be
of an age younger than that of the sub-appennines.<a name= "fnanchor_83" id= "fnanchor_83"></a><a href= "#footnote_83" class= "fnanchor">[83]</a> This sandstone
he found associated with the granite above Assuan, and covering the
cretaceous sandstone far into Nubia. It appears, therefore, that, in
the later ages of the tertiary period, this north-eastern part of Africa
must have been submerged, and that very energetic plutonic action
was going forward in the then bed of the sea. The remarkable fact
of the granite bursting through this modern sandstone is thus described
by Russegger:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><q>We arrived at a plateau of the Arabian Chain south-east of Assuan.
It is about 200 feet above the bed of the Nile, and consists of the
lower and upper sandstone, which are penetrated by innumerable granite
cones from 20 to 100 feet in height, arranged over the plateau in parallel
lines, very much resembling volcanic cones rising from a great cleft. The
sandstone is totally altered in texture near the granite, and has all the
appearance as if it had been exposed to a great heat. 'I cannot refrain,'
he says, 'from supposing that the granite must have burst, like a volcanic
product, through long wide rents in the sandstone, and that, in this way,
the conical hills were formed.'</q><a name= "fnanchor_84" id= "fnanchor_84"></a><a href= "#footnote_84" class= "fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>An eruption of a true granite during the period of the sub-appennine
formations, one possessing the same mineral structure as that
we know to have been erupted during the period of the palæozoic
rocks, would be a fact of so extraordinary a kind, that its age would
require to be established on the clearest evidence, and especially by
that of organic remains in the sandstone.</p>

<p>Having thus ventured&mdash;I trust without any want of the respect due
to so eminent a person&mdash;to reject the hypothesis proposed by Professor
Lepsius for the high levels of the Nile at Semne, indicated by
the sculptured marks he discovered, it may perhaps be expected that
I should offer another more probable explanation. If in some narrow
gorge of the river below Semne, a place had been described by
any traveller, where, from the nature of the banks, a great landslip,
or even an artificial dam, could have raised the bed to an adequate
height; that is, proportionate to the fall of the river, as it was more
distant from Semne, a bar that, in the course of a few centuries,
might have been gradually washed away, I might have ventured to
suggest such a solution of the problem. But without any information
of the existence of such a contraction of the river's channel, or
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 144]</span>any exact knowledge of the natural outlets and dams to running
water along the 250 miles of the Nile Valley, from Semne to Assuan,
it would be idle to offer even a conjecture. These marks are
unquestionably very difficult to account for, in the present imperfect
state of our knowledge of the structure of that portion of the Nile
Valley; and any competent geologist, well versed in the questions
of physical structure involved, who may hereafter visit Nubia, would
have a very interesting occupation in endeavouring to solve the difficulty.</p>

<h3 class="p4 break"><a name="Art_11"></a><cite>On the Salmon Tribe (Salmonidæ.)</cite></h3>

<p class="p2">So long as the family <i>Salmonidæ</i> remains circumscribed<a name= "fnanchor_N9" id= "fnanchor_N9"></a><a href= "#footnote_N9" class= "fnanchor">[N9]</a> as it
was established by Cuvier, it seems to be a type almost universally
diffused over the globe, occurring equally in the sea and in
fresh-water, so that we are left almost without a clue to its
natural relations to the surrounding world. Joh. Muller,
working out some suggestions of Prince Canino, and introducing
among them more precise anatomical characters, had
no sooner subdivided the old family of <i>Salmonidæ</i> into his
<i>Salmonidæ</i>, <i>Characini</i>, and <i>Scopelini</i>, than light immediately
spread over this field. Limited now to such fishes as, in
addition to the mere general character of former <i>Salmonidæ</i>,
have a false gill on the inner surface of the operculum, the
<i>Salmonidæ</i> appeared at once as fishes peculiar to the northern
temperate region, occurring in immense numbers all around
the Arctic<a name= "fnanchor_N10" id= "fnanchor_N10"></a><a href= "#footnote_N10" class= "fnanchor">[N10]</a> Sea, and running regularly up the rivers at certain
seasons of the year to deposit their spawn, while some live
permanently in fresh water. We have thus in the true <i>Salmonidæ</i>
actually a northern family of fishes, which, when
found in more temperate regions, occurs there in clear mountain
rivers, sometimes very high above the level of the sea,
near the limits of perpetual snow, or in deep, cold lakes.
That this family is adapted to the cold regions is most remarkably
exemplified by the fact that they all spawn late in
the season, at the approach of autumn or winter, when frost
or snow has reduced the temperature of the water in which
they live nearly to its lowest natural point. The embryos
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>grow within the egg very slowly for about two months before
they are hatched; while fecundated eggs of some other families
which spawn in spring and summer, give birth to young
fishes a few days after they are laid. The <i>Salmonidæ</i>, on the
contrary, are born at an epoch when the waters are generally
frozen up; that is at a period <em>when the maximum of temperature
is at the bottom of the water</em>, where the eggs and young
salmons remain among gravel, surrounded by a medium
which scarcely ever rises above thirty or forty degrees.</p>

<p>It is plain from these statements, and from what we know
otherwise of the habits of this family, that there is no one
upon the globe living under more uniform circumstances, and
nevertheless the species are extremely diversified, and we
find peculiar ones in all parts of the world, where the family
occurs at all. Thus we find in Lake Superior species which
do not exist in the course of the Mackenzie or Saskatchewan<a name= "fnanchor_N11" id= "fnanchor_N11"></a><a href= "#footnote_N11" class= "fnanchor">[N11]</a>,
and <i>vice versa</i>; others in the Columbia river which differ from
those of the Lena, Obi, and Yenisei, while Europe again has
its peculiar forms.</p>

<p>Whoever takes a philosophical view of the subject of Natural
History, and is familiar with the above stated facts, will
now understand why, notwithstanding the specific distinctions
there are between them, the trouts and white fishes are so
uniform all over the globe. It must be acknowledged that it
is owing to the uniformity of the physical condition in which
they occur, and to which they are so admirably adapted by
their anatomical structure, as well as by their instinct.
Running up and down the rapid rivers and mountain currents,
leaping even over considerable waterfalls, they are provided
with most powerful and active muscles; their tail is strong
and fleshy, and its broad basis indicates that its power is
concentrated; it is like the paddle of the Indian who propels
his canoe over the same waters. Their mouth is large, their
jaw strong, their teeth powerful, to enable them to secure
with ease the scanty prey with which they meet in these
deserts of cold water; and, nevertheless, though we cannot
but be struck by the admirable reciprocal adaptation between
the structure of the northern animals and the physical condition
in which they live, let us not mistake these adaptations
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>for a consequence of physical causes; let us not say that
trouts resemble each other so much because they originated
under uniform conditions; let us not say they have uniform
habits because there is no scope for diversity; let us not say
they spawn during winter, and rear their young under snow
and ice, because at that epoch they are safer from the attacks
of birds of prey; let us not say they are so intimately connected
with the physical world, because physical powers called
them into existence; but let us once look deeper, let us recognise
that this uniformity is imparted to a wonderfully
complicated structure: they are trouts with all their admirable
structure, their peculiar back-bones, their ornamented
skull, their powerful jaws, their moveable eyes, with their
thick, fatty skin and elegant scales, their ramified fin rays,
and with all that harmonious complication of structure which
characterizes the type of trouts, but over which a uniform
robe, as it were, is spread in a manner not unlike an almost
endless series of monotonous variations upon one brilliant
air, through the uniformity of which we still detect the same
melody, however disguised under the many undulations and
changes of which it is capable.</p>

<p>The instincts of trouts are not more controlled by climate
than those of other animals under different circumstances.
They are only made to perform at a particular season, best
suited to their organization, what others do at other times.
If it were not so, I do not see why all the different fishes,
living all the year round in the same brook, should not spawn
at the same season, and finally be transformed into one type;
have we not, on the contrary, in this diversity under identical
circumstances, a demonstrative evidence that there is another
cause which has acted, and is still acting, in the production
and preservation of these adaptations; a cause which endowed
living beings with the power of resisting the equalizing
influence of uniform agents, though at the same time placing
these agents and living beings under definite relations to each
other?</p>

<p>That trouts are not more influenced by physical conditions
than other animals is apparent from the fact that there are
lakes of small extent and of most uniform features, in which
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>two or three species of trout occur together, each with peculiar
habits; one more migratory, running up rivers during
the spawning season, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, while the other will never enter
running waters, and will spawn in quiet places near the shore;
one will hunt after its prey, while the other will wait for it in
ambuscade; one will feed upon fish, the other upon insects.
Here we have an example of species with different habits,
where there would scarcely seem to be room for diversity in the
physical condition in which they live; again, there are others
living together in immense sheets of water, where there would
seem to be ample scope for diversity, among which we observe
no great differences, as is the case between the Siscowet and
the lake trout in the great northern lakes.</p>

<p>If these facts, statements, and inductions were not sufficient
to satisfy the reader of the correctness of my views, I would
at once refer to another material fact, furnished us by the
family of <i>Salmonidæ</i>, namely, the existence of two essential
modifications of the true type of trouts, occurring everywhere
together under the same circumstances, showing the same
general characters, back-bones, skull, brain, composition of
the mouth, intestines, gills, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, but differing in the size
of the mouth, and in the almost absolute want of teeth, these
groups being that of the white fishes, <i>Coregoni</i>, and that of
the true trouts, <i>Salmones</i>.</p>

<p>Now, I ask, where is there, within the natural geographical
limits of distribution of <i>Salmonidæ</i>, a discriminating
power between the physical elements under which they live,
which could have introduced these differences?&mdash;a discriminating
power which, allotting to all certain characters, should
have modified others to such an extent as to produce apparently
different types under the same modification of the
general plan of structure. Why should there be, at the same
time, under the same circumstances, under the same geographical
distribution, white fishes with the habits of trouts,&mdash;spawning
like them in the fall, growing their young like them
during winter,&mdash;if there were not an infinitely wise Supreme
Power, if there were not a personal God, who, having first
designed, created the universe, and modelled our solar system,
called successively, at different epochs, such animals into
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 148]</span>existence under the different circumstances prevailing over
various parts of the globe, as would suit best this general
plan, according to which man was at last to be placed at the
head of creation? Let us remember all this, and we have a
voice uttering louder and louder the cry which the external
world equally proclaims, that there is a Creator, an intelligent
and wise Creator, an omnipotent Creator of all that exists,
has existed, and shall exist.</p>

<p>To come back to the <i>Salmonidæ</i>, I might say, that when
properly studied, there is not a species in nature, there is not
a system of organs in any given species, there is not a peculiarity
in the details of each of these systems, which does not
lead to the same general results, and which is not on that
account equally worth our consideration.</p>

<p>A minute distinction between species is again, above all,
the foundation of our most extensive views of the whole, and
of our most sublime generalizations. The species of <i>Salmonidæ</i>
call particularly our attention, from the minuteness
of the characters upon which their distinction rests. Their
number in the north of this continent (North America) is far
greater than would be supposed from the mere investigation
of those of the great lakes; but I shall, for the present, limit
myself to these.&mdash;<cite>Agassiz, Lake Superior</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 366.</p>

characteristics of each, but was more of the nature of the
latter body, in which case the mere fact of its appearing
at the epoch of the shooting-stars, maybe considered in some
degree significant of a connection, more especially when confirmed
by a second instance in another year; while, moreover,
the November period of shooting-stars had not then been
suspected; and these two observations not only serve to confirm
that period, but also to give the retrogression of the
nodes of the orbit, which has been suspected.</p>

<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>about ten in the evening, I was in the Transit-room, engaged in observing
the passage of a star, when a blaze of intensely vivid light
was observed a little to the West of North, about the height of the
Equator, and which continued for perhaps a couple of seconds.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"While registering the observation, a loud report was heard
nearly in the same direction, resembling that of a piece of heavy
ordnance at the distance of two or three miles. The interval between
the flash and the report reaching me, must have been between
the limits of 2<sup>m</sup> 40<sup>s</sup> and 2<sup>m</sup> 45<sup>s</sup>, from the circumstance of my
having observed the light just before the star (<i>g Ceti</i>) had come to
the second wire<a name= "fnanchor_86" id= "fnanchor_86"></a><a href= "#footnote_86" class= "fnanchor">[86]</a> of the instrument, which, on referring to the transit-book,
would have taken place at 23<sup>h</sup> 57<sup>m</sup> 47<sup>s</sup>·6 nearly, and therefore
the occurrence of the phenomenon may be safely referred to 23<sup>h</sup>
57<sup>m</sup> 45<sup>s</sup>; and as, on hearing the report, I immediately consulted
the Sidereal clock, which indicated 0<sup>h</sup> 0<sup>m</sup> 30<sup>s</sup>, I think that the error
in assuming the elapsed time as above cannot be supposed to amount
to five seconds.</p>

<p class="blockquote">"There was little peculiar in the state of the weather or atmosphere;
the day had been rather more than usually cool, the highest
temperature being 68° Fahrenheit, the wind from the south, and
moderate, with slight passing showers. The evening was nearly
clear, with a light air from the south-west, atmosphere rather dry;
the barometer standing at 30<sup><abbr title="inches">in</abbr></sup>·20, and the thermometer at 52°, and
both were observed to rise suddenly after the explosion, the barometer

<h3 class="p4 break"><a name="Art_13"></a><cite>Discovery of the Great Lake <q>Ngami</q> of South Africa.</cite></h3>

<p class="p2">Geographical discovery in Africa has even excited more
interest than similar explorations in any other part of the
world, and with reason&mdash;for, while it is one of the oldest and
earliest peopled of lands; while the human race first attained
there a high degree of civilization, and a high degree of knowledge
in the arts of peace and war, of science and literature;
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>with a grandeur in some things, and a skill in others never
since equalled; yet it is now the country of all others on the
face of the globe concerning which we know least. In other
continents there are undoubtedly parts not yet visited by
Europeans, or worthy of being more fully explored; but they
are but inconsiderable spots compared with the almost boundless
spaces of Central Africa, where no foot of a white man
has ever yet trod, and of the greater part of which no semi-fabulous
native accounts even have ever reached us. So that
age after age the civilization of the enlightened nations of the
world is gradually losing the hold which it once had, at
least along the northern shores of this vast continent; and
the land of Ham is gradually reverting to a state of primeval
wilderness, fenced in from all the rest of the world by the
obstructive power of ignorance and position.</p>

<p>And yet to no other part of the world has so continued a
stream of geographical explorers been poured, and is even
pouring still; but invariably either the deadly climate of the
more fertile parts, or the passive but all-powerful impediments
offered by the more desert portions, as well as the active
opposition of natives, more savage and sanguinary than
in any other part of the world, have invariably, by death or
otherwise, put an untimely stop to the progress of the travellers.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it must be highly encouraging
to all interested in the prosecutions of African geography, to
hear that an actual and tangible discovery, and one of the
most important kind for the country in which it was effected,
and for the prosecution of still further research, has just
been made, in the fact of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> David Livingston, a missionary
of the London Society, having at least reached the
great lake<a name= "fnanchor_87" id= "fnanchor_87"></a><a href= "#footnote_87" class= "fnanchor">[87]</a> of South Africa.</p>

<p>The circumstance requires perhaps something more than
mere notice, and to have more names mentioned in connection
with it, from its being part of a general system of co-operation
in which many have borne a part, and a very important
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>and necessary part, towards the result which has been
finally achieved; and at the very least, the name of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Mr Moffat, the fellow missionary of Mr Livingston, deserves
mention whenever the great lake is spoken of.</p>

<p>Its existence had been suspected long since, and its discovery
has been a constant theme of conversation for many
years past at the Cape. But yet the information of its whereabout,
and size, and nature, were so very scanty, as to throw
more doubt over the matter, the further that it was examined
into. Up to a very recent date, the only persons who had ever
been able within the colony to bear testimony to the fact of
the existence of the great lake, from personal knowledge,
were two young Bechuana brought down by D. A. Smith's
expedition. They said, that when they were children, and
their tribe was flying from their enemies, they had been at
one period close to the great lake; but, after the closest
cross-questioning, they left the matter more uncertain than
ever, for from the length of time that their tribe was flying
about in the desert in various directions, it would have been
quite possible to have reached the sea either to the east or
west, or the colony to the south; and nothing certain could
be made out as to the mean resulting direction of the marching
and countermarching.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many were the ardent explorers who endeavoured
to reach this consummation, so greatly to be desired,
amid the arid plains of South Africa. The last which started,
and by far the most important of all that were ever organized
in South Africa, was that of the Cape Town <q>Association
for Exploring Central Africa,</q> and which started in 1834,
and returned in 1836. The party consisted of about seven
Europeans, as many waggons, and about thirty natives. The
whole was under the direction of Dr Andrew Smith, staff-surgeon,
who had admirably qualified himself for the command,
by the experience of very many years spent chiefly in
the interior, and amongst the natives. Among the members of
the expedition, were an astronomer, well supplied with instruments,
and two artists, and Mr Charles Bell for landscape,
topography, and the manners and customs of the natives;
and another, Mr Ford, for the natural history department.
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>Dr Smith took upon himself especially the zoology, the ethnology,
and geology; and the others all contributed according
to their powers, while the whole of their notes and journals
of every kind were to be made over to the association.</p>

<p>The expedition started in 1834, reached at length the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Mr Moffat's residence at Kuruman, then the outpost of the
Missionary stations; by him it was carried on further into
the Zoolah country, to the abode of the great chief Umsiligas.
This seemed for various reasons the furthest northing that
the expedition could make, but a small party went on in light
marching order a little further, so as to be just able to say
that 23° south latitude had actually been reached, before the
retrograde movement was begun.</p>

<p>The chief result of this expedition has been the publication
of Dr A. Smith's beautiful and valuable zoological work, for
the publication of which the government granted a sum of
money.</p>

<p>The personal journal, the astronomical, geographical, geological,
and meteorological observations, have still to come;
likewise Dr Smith's own observations touching the history,
language, and other particulars of the various tribes of aborigines
whom he met with; as well as Mr Charles Bell's
inimitable drawings of the manners, customs, and appearances
of the natives, and his expressive landscape scenery.</p>

<p>This degree or measure of success seemed to put the great
lake further off than ever. Europeans despaired of their ever
finding or beholding<a name= "fnanchor_N12" id= "fnanchor_N12"></a><a href= "#footnote_N12" class= "fnanchor">[N12]</a> it, and none but traders and huntsmen
subsequently traversed that part merely of the road towards it,
which the expedition did pass over; while the only scientific
mission which has acted since in South Africa, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, that
of Captain Sir J. E. Alexander, sent out by the Royal Geographical
Society of London,&mdash;hopeless, apparently, of doing
anything by following Dr Smith's route, travelled and explored
along the western coast.</p>

<p>It was remarked long since by the North American Indians
and other aborigines, that the <q>black-robe chiefs of
the mission</q> had always preceded the daring hunter and
the crafty trader; and in no country has the <em>preceding</em> spirit
of the missionaries been more evident than in South Africa.
While pushing their stations continually further and further
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>into the interior, they christianize and civilize the tribes as
they go, and so leave the way paved and open behind them;
a most important condition, when it is remembered what excessive
distances a traveller is there from his resources, and
in what an impracticable country.</p>

<p>Silently, but surely, has this operation been going on, until
as it were, almost by natural causes, a point has been reached,
within which the lake was but at a moderate distance. Starting
from Mr Moffat's advanced post of Kuruman, Mr Livingston
had founded the station of Kolobeng further north;
and then it only required a small advance of money to pay
the expense of the long contemplated journey. That sum
was furnished by two lay gentlemen, Messrs Murray and
Oswell,&mdash;and this great cynosure of South African geography,
fell, in the ripeness of time, an easy prize.</p>

<p>But if we have this much to say for the effective lever
which the missionary system affords for geographical discovery,
we cannot say so much as we should like in favour of
the manner in which it has been worked in this instance,
though it may be better than in the generality of cases.</p>

<p>There has been of late, it must be confessed, rather a decline
of the true scientific spirit of geographical exploration;
and men have too frequently been contented with filling their
books with accounts merely of what they shot and what they
eat; unable to give any more intelligent account of the country
than the natives themselves.</p>

<p>Hardly any better, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr Rebman, who is supposed
to have discovered in 5° <abbr title="south latitude">S. lat.</abbr>, and 3 or 400 miles within the
eastern coast of Africa, a mountain reaching above the
limits of perpetual snow, and which may be the source of
the Nile on the one hand, and of the rivers which feed the
great lake Ngami on the other; for though he has been
twice to the mountains, yet he has sent home such puerile
statements, that the fact of its being snow at all which was
<em>thought</em> to have been seen, is now contested; and the height,
latitude, longitude, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, of the mountain are quite uncertain.</p>

<p>Mr Livingston has done much better than this, though
there is almost everything for the geographer, the botanist,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, to do; but no fault is to be imputed to him, he had
a higher object in view: we mention the case so prominently
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span>here, rather to incite scientific men to go and do their
part. We append Mr Livingston's letter to the end of this
notice, and will merely condense here the principal notabilia.</p>

<p>The latitude of the <abbr title="east">E.</abbr> corner of the lake at its junction
with the effluence the Zonga, was measured with a sextant,
to be 20° 20´ <abbr title="south">S.</abbr> The longitude was estimated at 24° <abbr title="east">E.</abbr>, consequently
about midway between the <abbr title="east">E.</abbr> and <abbr title="west">W.</abbr> coasts.
The height above the level of the sea was thermometrically
determined at 2200 feet. The length and breadth were
stated by the natives at 70 and 15 miles; Mr Livingston
saw in the former direction an uninterrupted horizon of water.</p>

<p>The feeder of the lake coming down from the north was
described only by the natives; but its water being very clear,
even during its annual risings, and these being incomprehensible
to the inhabitants of that part of the country, this course
may be expected to be long, and not improbably rising from
a snowy mountain.</p>

<p>The effluent of the lake, the Zonga, was travelled along
by Mr L. for 300 miles; as the water was clear, the stream
placid, the banks thickly clothed with beds of reeds, and the
height above the sea 2200 feet,&mdash;it may be presumed that
this river does <em>not</em> communicate with the ocean, and that it
is gradually dissipated like other rivers there by evaporation
and absorption.</p>

<p>The banyan, the palmyra, and the baobab, taking the place
of the cactus, aloe, euphorbia and acacia, indicate the arrival
in a better watered country and a totally different botanical
region than any previously reached from the Cape.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the lake <q>Bayeiye,</q> seem to be a new
race; their language was unknown; and they possess several
remarkable habits and customs totally at variance with the
characteristics of all the South African tribes, Hottentots,
Bushmen, Caffres, Bechuana, Zoolahs, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, south of the
tropics; as for instance, their having <em>canoes</em>, killing the hippopotami<a name= "fnanchor_N13" id= "fnanchor_N13"></a><a href= "#footnote_N13" class= "fnanchor">[N13]</a>
with harpoons attached to ropes, and catching fish in
nets.</p>

<p>The head of a fish which abounds in the lake, as well as a
fearful fly which stings the oxen to death, have been sent
home, and are declared to be new.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we have the pleasure of adding that although
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>the Geographical Society could not exactly award with propriety
their Royal gold medal to discoveries in their science;
made in a secondary point of view, and but indifferently described,
when it should be reserved for a Bruce or a Humboldt,&mdash;yet
they have with great satisfaction and alacrity
awarded the value of the medal in money; and it is devoutly
to be hoped that Mr L. may be spared to continue the exploration
which he has thus auspiciously begun.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><i>Letter from the Rev. David Livingston, addressed to the Rev. Arthur Tidman,<br />
Foreign Secretary, London Missionary Society.</i></p>

<p class="p2 justr smaller"><i>Banks of the River Zonga, 3rd September 1849.</i></p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I left my station, Kolobeng (situated 25° South lat., 26 East
long.), on the 1st of June last, in order to carry into effect the intention, of
which I had previously informed you, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> to open a new field in the North, by
penetrating the great obstacle to our progress, called the Desert, which, stretching
away on our West, North-West, and North, has hitherto presented an insurmountable
barrier to Europeans.</p>

<p class="blockquote">A large party of Griquas, in about thirty waggons, made many and persevering
efforts at two different points last year; but, though inured to the climate,
and stimulated by the prospect of much gain from the ivory they expected to
procure, want of water compelled them to retreat.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Two gentlemen, to whom I had communicated my intention of proceeding to
the oft-reported lake beyond the desert, came from England for the express
purpose of being present at the discovery, and to their liberal and zealous co-operation
we are especially indebted for the success with which that and other
objects have been accomplished. While waiting for their arrival, seven men
came to me from the Batavana, a tribe living on the banks of the lake, with an
earnest request from their chief for a visit. But the path by which they had
come to Kolobeng was impracticable for waggons; so, declining their guidance
I selected the more circuitous route, by which the Bermangueato usually pass,
and, having Bakwains for guides, their self-interest in our success was secured
by my promising to carry any ivory they might procure for their chiefs in my
waggon; and right faithfully they performed their task.</p>

<p class="blockquote">When Sekhomi, the Bermangueato chief, became aware of our intentions to
pass into the regions beyond him, with true native inhumanity he sent men before
us to drive away all the bushmen and Bakalihari from our route, in order
that, being deprived of their assistance in the search for water, we might, like
the Griquas above mentioned, be compelled to return. This measure deprived
me of the opportunity of holding the intercourse with these poor outcasts I
might otherwise have enjoyed. But through the good providence of God, after
travelling about 300 miles from Kolobeng, we struck on a magnificent river
on the 4th of July, and without further difficulty, in so far as water was concerned,
by winding along its banks nearly 300 miles more, we reached the
Batavana, on the lake Ngami, by the beginning of August.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Previous to leaving this beautiful river on my return home, and commencing
our route across the desert, I feel anxious to furnish you with the impressions
produced on my mind by it and its inhabitants, the Bakoba or Bayeiye. They
are a totally distinct race from the Bechuanas. They call themselves Bayeiye
(or men), while the term Bakoba (the name has somewhat of the meaning of
<q>slaves,</q>) is applied to them by the Bechuanas. Their complexion is darker
than that of the Bechuanas; and, of 300 words I collected of their language<a name= "fnanchor_N14" id= "fnanchor_N14"></a><a href= "#footnote_N14" class= "fnanchor">[N14]</a>,
only 21 bear any resemblance to Sitchuana. They paddle along the rivers
and lake in canoes hollowed out of the trunks of single trees; take fish in nets
made of a weed which abounds on the banks; and kill hippopotami with
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>harpoons attached to ropes. We greatly admired the frank, manly bearing
of these inland sailors. Many of them spoke Sitchuana fluently, and, while the
waggon went along the bank, I greatly enjoyed following the windings of the
river in one of their primitive craft, and visiting their little villages among
the reed. The banks are beautiful beyond any we had ever seen, except perhaps
some parts of the Clyde. They are covered, in general, with gigantic
trees, some of them bearing fruit, and quite new. Two of the Baobab<a name= "fnanchor_N15" id= "fnanchor_N15"></a><a href= "#footnote_N15" class= "fnanchor">[N15]</a> variety
measured 70 to 76 feet in circumference. The higher we ascended the river,
the broader it became, until we often saw more than 100 yards of clear deep
water between the broad belt of reed which grows in the shallower parts.
The water was clear as crystal, and as we approached the point of junction
with other large rivers <em>reported to exist</em> in the North, it was quite soft and cold.
The fact that the Zonga is connected with large rivers coming from the north
awakens emotions in my mind, which make the discovery of the lake dwindle
out of sight. It opens the prospect of a highway, capable of being quickly
traversed by boats, to a large section of well-peopled territory.</p>

<p class="blockquote">One remarkable feature in this river is its periodical rise and fall. It has
risen nearly three feet in height since our arrival, and this is the dry season.
That the rise is not caused by rains is evident from the water being so pure.
Its purity and softness increased as we ascended towards its junction with the
Tamunakle, from which, although connected with the lake, it derives the present
increased supply. The sharpness of the air caused an amazing keenness
of appetite, at an elevation of little more than 2000 feet above the level of the
sea (water boiled at 207½° thermometer), and the reports of the Bayeiye, that
the waters came from a mountainous region, suggested the conclusion that the
increase of the water, at the beginning and middle of the dry season, must be
derived from melting snow.</p>

<p class="blockquote">All the rivers reported, to the north of this, have Bayeiye upon them, and
there are other tribes on their banks. To one of these, after visiting the Batavana,
and taking a peep at the broad part of the lake, we directed our course;
but the Batavana chief managed to obstruct us, by keeping all the Bayeiye
near the ford on the opposite bank of the Zonga. African chiefs invariably
dislike to see strangers passing <em>them to tribes beyond</em>. Sebitoane,&mdash;the chief
who in former years saved the life of Sechele our chief,&mdash;lives about ten days
north-east of the Batavana. The latter sent a present as a token of gratitude.
This would have been a good introduction; the knowledge of the language,
however, is the <em>best</em> we can have. I endeavoured to construct a raft, at a part
which was only fifty or sixty yards wide, but the wood, though sun-dried, was
so heavy it sunk immediately; another kind would not bear my weight, although
a considerable portion of my person was under water. I could easily
have swam across, and fain would have done it; but, landing without clothes,
and then demanding of the Bakoba the loan of a boat, would scarcely be the
thing for a messenger of peace, even though no alligator met me in the passage.
These and other thoughts were revolving in my mind as I stood in the water,&mdash;for
most sorely do I dislike to be beaten,&mdash;when my kind and generous friend
Mr Oswell, with whom <em>alone</em> the visit to Sebitoane was to be made, offered to
bring up a boat at his own expense from the Cape, which, after visiting the
chief, and coming round the north end of the lake, will become missionary property.
To him and our other companion Mr Murray, I feel greatly indebted,&mdash;<em>for
the chief expense of the journey has been borne by them</em>. <em>They</em> could not have
reached this point without my assistance; but, for the aid they have rendered
in opening up this field, I feel greatly indebted; and, should any public notice
be taken of this journey, I shall feel obliged to the directors if they express my
thankfulness.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Bayeiye or Bakoba listened to the statements made from the Divine
Word with great attention, and, if I am not mistaken, seemed to understand
the message of mercy delivered better than any people to whom I have
preached for the <em>first</em> time. They have invariably a great many charms in the
villages; stated the name of God in their language (without the least hesitation)
to be <q>Oreeja;</q> mentioned the name of the first man and woman, and
some traditionary statements respecting the flood. I shall not, however, take
these for certain, till I have more knowledge of their language. They are
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>found dwelling among the reed all round the lake, and on the banks of all the
rivers to the north.</p>

<p class="blockquote">With the periodical flow of the rivers great shoals of fish descend. The
people could give no reason for the rise of the water, further than that a chief,
who lives in a part of the country in the north, called Mazzekiva, kills a man
annually and throws his body into the stream, after which the water begins to
flow.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The sketch which I enclose is intended to convey an idea of the river Zonga
and the lake Ngami. The name of the latter is pronounced as if written
with the Spanish ñ, the <i>g</i> being inserted to shew that the ringing sound is
required. The meaning is <q>Great Water.</q> The latitude, taken by a Sextant
on which I can fully depend, was 20° 20´ south, at the north-east extremity,
where it is joined by the Zonga; longitude about 24° east. <em>We do not, however,
know it with certainty.</em> We left our waggon near the Batavana town, and
rode on horseback about six miles beyond it to the broad part. It gradually
widens out into a Firth about 15 miles across, as you go south from the town,
and in the south-south-west presents a large horizon of water. <em>It is reported</em> to
be about 70 miles in length, bends round to the north-west, and there receives
another river similar to the Zonga. The Zonga runs to the north-east. The
thorns were so thickly planted near the upper part of this river, that we left
all our waggons standing about 180 miles from the lake, except that of Mr Oswell,
in which we travelled the remaining distance; but for this precaution our
oxen would have been unable to return. I am now standing at a tribe of
Bakurutse, and shall in a day or two re-enter the desert.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The breadth marked is intended to show the difference between the size of
the Zonga, after its junction with the Tamunakle and before it. The farther it
runs east, the narrower it becomes. The course is shewn by the arrow-heads.
<em>The rivers not seen, but reported by the natives</em>, are put down in dotted lines.
The dotted lines running north of the river and lake, shew the probable course
of the Tamunakle, and another river which falls into the lake at its north-west
extremity. The arrow-heads shew also the direction of <em>its</em> flow. At the part
marked by the name of the Chief Mosing it is not more than 50 or 60 yards in
breadth, while at 20° 7´ it is more than 100, and very deep.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The principal disease reported to prevail at certain seasons appears, from the
account of the symptoms the natives give, to be pneumonia and not fever.
When the wind rises to an ordinary breeze, such immense clouds of dust arise
from the numerous dried-out lakes called salt-pans, that the whole atmosphere
becomes quite yellow, and one cannot distinguish objects more than two miles off.
It causes irritation in the eyes, and, as wind prevails almost constantly at certain
seasons, this impalpable powder may act as it does among the grinders in Sheffield.
We observed cough among them, a complaint almost unknown at Kolobeng.
Musquitoes swarm in summer, and the Banyan and Palmyra give in
some parts an Indian cast to the scenery.</p>

and compensating, or correcting influences of animal life in
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>preserving the uniformity of composition of the atmosphere. In the
earth we witness influences of the like kind, as it were opposed to
each other, and producing opposite effects. Water, in its operation,
aided by air, may be considered as destructive, wearing away rocks
and mountains, and carrying their comminuted parts to lower levels,
and even into the sea, to be buried in its depths. Fire may be considered
as restorative; acting below the surface, it melts and also
consolidates, according to its degree of intensity, tending to reproduce
crystalline rocks in one instance, and stratified in the other. Even
when it appears most eminently to act according to our ordinary
notions of its operation as a devastating and destroying agent, for
example, in the eruption of a volcano, the ashes which are discharged
into the atmosphere, and are widely scattered by the winds, even
when they fall on the adjoining countries, may help to supply the
place of the old surface-materials, carried away by streams and floods,
and to renovate the soil with new elements of fertility. And acting
in another form and manner, the same power which occasions volcanic
eruptions appears to be productive of another effect, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the gradual
elevation of the bed of the sea, tending to the formation of new
land, of which we seem to have examples in the extension of certain
coasts, and the appearance of rocks and dry land above the waves,
preceded by a gradual diminution of the water over the spots where
these remarkable phenomena occur.</p>

<p>Of most of the geological changes alluded to in the preceding remarks,
the West Indies afford well marked instances.</p>

<p>From the continent of America are to be seen vast rivers flowing
into the sea, turbid with the detritus of the country through which
they have descended in a course of thousands of miles, and discolouring
and freshening the waters with which they mix at an extraordinary
distance from land. Between their mouths on the coasts and
their rapids in the boundary hills of the interior, immense level, or
almost level tracts occur,&mdash;marsh, morass, and sandbank, neither
land nor water, covered chiefly with aquatic plants,&mdash;tracts formed by
deposits from the great rivers, and commonly of materials somewhat
coarser and heavier than those which are longer suspended and are
carried out into the sea in consequence of their greater fineness.</p>

<p>In many of the islands not only are there rocks to be seen evidently
of volcanic origin&mdash;columnar basalt, trachyte<a name= "fnanchor_N16" id= "fnanchor_N16"></a><a href= "#footnote_N16" class= "fnanchor">[N16]</a>, and many varieties
of tufa, but also craters from whence eruptions have taken place,
and in which the fires are hardly yet extinct that once acted, as is
indicated by the hot steams and exhalations still proceeding from
them.</p>

<p>Moreover, in some of these islands, rocks of volcanic origin, crystalline
in their structure, and totally destitute of organic remains, are
associated with others of a perfectly different character, stratified and
abounding in organic remains,&mdash;various species of sea shells and of
coral; and it is worthy of notice, that, in one of the instances in
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>which the appearance is best observed, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, at Brimstone Hill, in St
Christopher's, the volcanic rock, flanked by the stratified rock, and
the latter&mdash;an aggregate of shells, coral, and calcareous marl, has its
strata highly inclined, tilted up as it were by the former.</p>

<p>Other islands, or parts of islands, occur, in which there are only
partial volcanic traces, and these not so much of volcanic action and
disturbance on the spot, as of materials, such as ashes, thrown up by
volcanoes, and those distant ones. The island Barbados is an
example. Composed in great parts of a calcareous aggregate, in
which organic remains abound, it has very much the character, in its
peculiar features, of having been raised from the bed of the ocean
(where it is certain it was formed), by some mighty force, slowly
acting, and which, it is probable, is acting still.</p>

<p class="moreafter">Nor is there wanting in these seas instances of islands, in which
almost every variety of formation is exemplified. Barbados, in its
smaller portion&mdash;the Scotland district, exhibits some interesting
varieties, such as beds of chalk abounding in the remains of microscopic
animalcules, strata of sandstone, some siliceous, some calcareous;
the one without organic remains, containing, however, deposits
of coal and bitumen; the other&mdash;the latter having included in them
organic remains, and of a kind to connect them with the calcareous
rock of which the larger portion of the island is formed, for instance,
the spines of echini and the teeth of squali. The larger islands,
Trinidad and Jamaica, Port Rico, and Cuba, yield examples,
still more in point. In Trinidad I am not aware that any volcano,
or crater of one, has been discovered, or any rocks evidently
volcanic in their origin; but from the imperfectly crystalline
rocks, destitute of organic remains and distinct stratification, to clays
and marls, to mud eruptions or volcanoes as these are sometimes
called, through limestones and sandstones stratified, and containing
organic remains, a tolerably well-marked series may be traced.
In the adjoining and smaller island Tobago some of the same series
are observable, but in a broken manner, not a little interesting and
instructive. There, highly crystalline rocks, destitute of organic remains,<a name= "fnanchor_N17" id= "fnanchor_N17"></a><a href= "#footnote_N17" class= "fnanchor">[N17]</a>
are in juxtaposition with others abounding in these remains;
coral rock is even found resting on granite; and in another situation
the latter rock is contiguous to mica slate, in which quartz in mass
is not of rare occurrence.</p>

<cite>On the Differences between Progressive, Embryonic, and Prophetic
Types<br />in the Succession of Organized Beings<br />through
the whole Range of Geological Times.</cite></h3>

<p class="p2">It was a great improvement in our zoological investigations when
the differences in their relations, according to the various degrees of
affinity or analogy which exist between animals, were pointed out,
and successively better understood. In earlier times, zoologists made
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>no distinction between the different relations which existed among
animals. Affinity and analogy, so dissimilar in their essential characters,
were constantly mistaken one for the other; and upon the
peculiarities which struck the observer most at first sight, animals
were brought together, sometimes upon the ground of true affinity,
sometimes, also, upon the ground of close analogy; and though
comparative anatomy did put the mistakes arising from such confusion
right, by showing that external appearances were sometimes
deceptive, and that a more intimate knowledge of internal structure
was necessary fully to understand the real relations between animals,
there remained, nevertheless, a degree of uncertainty in many<a name= "fnanchor_N18" id= "fnanchor_N18"></a><a href= "#footnote_N18" class= "fnanchor">[N18]</a> cases,
as long as the principles of affinities and of analogies were not fully
distinguished. Every naturalist now knows that true relationship&mdash;affinity&mdash;depends
upon a unity in structure, however diversified the
forms may be under which their fundamental structure is displayed.
For instance, the affinity of whales and the other mammalia was not
understood before it was shown that, under the form of fishes, these
animals had truly the same structure as the highest <i>vertebrata</i>.</p>

<p>Again, the forms of <i>cetacea</i> exemplify the analogy there is between
whales and fishes. They are <em>related</em> to mammalia; they are
<em>analogous</em><a name= "fnanchor_N19" id= "fnanchor_N19"></a><a href= "#footnote_N19" class= "fnanchor">[N19]</a> to fishes; they bear close affinity to the mammals which
nurse their young with milk; they have rather close analogy to the
gill-breathing fishes.</p>

<p>Since the fossil animals which have existed during former periods
upon the surface of our globe, and which have successively peopled
the ocean and the dry land, have been more carefully studied than
they were at the beginning of these investigations; since they are
no longer considered as mere curiosities, but as the earlier representatives
of an order of things which has been gradually and successively
developed throughout the history of our globe, facts have been
brought to light which now require a very careful examination, and
will lead to a more complete understanding of the various relations
which exist between these extinct types and those which still continue
to live in our days. Upon close comparison of these facts, I have
been led to distinguish two sorts of relations between the extinct
animals, and those of our days, which seem to me to have been
either overlooked or not sufficiently distinguished. Indeed, the
general results derived from Palæontological investigations, seem
scarcely to have gone beyond showing that the animals of former ages
are specifically and frequently also generically distinct from those
of the present creation; and also to establish certain graduation between
them, agreeing more or less with the degree of perfection
which we recognise between the living animals according to their
structure.</p>

<p>It is now pretty generally understood that fishes, which rank lowest
among the <i>Vertebrata</i>, have existed alone during the oldest periods;
that the reptiles which, in the gradation of structure, rank next
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>above them, have followed at a later period; that still later the birds,
which, according to their anatomy, rank above reptiles, have next
made their appearance; and that mammalia, which stand highest,
have been introduced last, and even among these the lower families
seem to have been more numerous, before the higher ones prevailed
over them. Man, at last, has been created, only after all other types
had acquired their full development. These facts which, in such
generality are fully exemplified in every country in the order of succession
of the different fossil characteristics of the various geological
deposits, shew plainly that a gradation really exists in this succession,
and constitutes one of the most prominent characters of the development
of the animal kingdom as a whole.</p>

<p>If we investigate, however, this gradation, and the order of succession
of animals more closely, we cannot but be struck with the different
relations which exist between the fossils and the living animals.
Many extinct types have been pointed out as characteristic of different
geological periods, which combine, as it were, peculiarities which
at present are found separately in different families of animals.</p>

<p>I may mention as such, the <i>Ichthyosaur</i><a name= "fnanchor_N20" id= "fnanchor_N20"></a><a href= "#footnote_N20" class= "fnanchor">[N20]</a>, with their fish-like vertebræ,
their dolphin or porpoise-like general form, and several special
characters reminding us of their close relation to the Crocodilian
reptiles; thus combining characters of different classes in the most
extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>Again, the <i>Pterodactyli</i>, in which reptilian characters are combined
with peculiarities reminding us both of birds and bats.</p>

<p>Again, the large carnivorous<a name= "fnanchor_N21" id= "fnanchor_N21"></a><a href= "#footnote_N21" class= "fnanchor">[N21]</a> fishes of the coal period, combining
peculiarities of the <i>Saurians</i>, with true fish characters; and so on.</p>

<p>These relations are of an entirely different kind from those which
I have pointed out between some of the older fossils and the early
stage of growth of the living representatives of the same families.</p>

<p>For instance, the fossil fishes with a heterocercal tail, found below
the new red sandstone, down to the lowest deposits, reminds us
of the peculiar termination of the vertebral column in all fish embryos
of species living in the present period, to whatever family they
may belong, indicating a similarity of structure in the oldest representative
of this class, with the earliest condition of the germs of
those animals in our days.</p>

<p>Let us now examine whether we can properly understand the
bearings of these relations, and the meaning of such differences.</p>

<p>In the first place, I have mentioned the gradual progress, which
is observed in the succession of the different classes of <i>Vertebrata</i>.
This progress is exemplified by a series of types which differ from
each other, but which shew, when arranged in a series, a gradation
which agrees in general with the structural gradation, which we may
establish upon anatomical evidence. For instance, the salamanders,
with their various forms, rank below the tailless<a name= "fnanchor_N22" id= "fnanchor_N22"></a><a href= "#footnote_N22" class= "fnanchor">[N22]</a> <i>Batrachians</i>.</p>

<p>And where we have a succession of those animals in the tertiary
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>deposits as they occur in various parts of Europe, we may fairly say
that the fossils form, in their succession, a series of progressive
types.</p>

<p>Another example may perhaps illustrate the point more fully.
The <i>orthocera</i> of the oldest periods precede the curved lituites, which,
in their turn, are followed by the circumvolute<a name= "fnanchor_N23" id= "fnanchor_N23"></a><a href= "#footnote_N23" class= "fnanchor">[N23]</a> nautilus. Here,
again, we have a natural gradation of a series of progressive types.
Again, among <i>crinoids</i>, we find, in the older deposits, a variety of
species resting upon a stem, while free crinoids begin to appear only
during the secondary deposit and prevail, in the present creation,
over those attached to the soil. Here, again, we have a series of
progressive types developed successively, which are apparently independent
of each other and seem to bear no other relation to each
than that arising from the general character of the group to which
they belong. Such types exemplify simply in the groups to which
they belong, a real progress in the successive development of the
peculiarities which characterise them as natural divisions among animals.
Such forms I shall call <i>Progressive Types</i>.</p>

<p>The relations, however, which are exemplified in the oldest
fishes, in the ichthyosaurians, in the pterodactyls or in the megalosaurians,
seem to me to be clearly of a different character, and to
differ from simple progressive types, inasmuch as those which appear
earlier, combine peculiarities which, at a later period, appear separately
in distinct forms. For instance, the reptilian characters
which we recognise in the sauroid fishes, are developed at a later
period in animals no longer belonging to the class of fishes, but constituting
by themselves new types, provided with additional peculiarities
which separate them fully from the fishes in general, as well
as from those fishes in which we recognise some relation to reptiles
during a period when no reptile existed.</p>

<p>Again, the ichthyosaurians, though true reptiles appearing long
after fishes had been called into existence, and during an early period
of the history of the reptiles, still shew their relation to fishes by the
character of their vertebral column, and foreshadow, as it were, in
their form, the cetacea of later ages, as well as many forms of the
gigantic saurians of the secondary period. The same may be said of
the pterodactyls, which are also true reptiles, but, in which the anterior
extremity foreshadow peculiarities characteristic of birds and
bats. Such types I shall call <i>Prophetic Types</i>.</p>

<p>To an analytic mind the examination of the peculiarities of such
animals may foretell<a name= "fnanchor_N24" id= "fnanchor_N24"></a><a href= "#footnote_N24" class= "fnanchor">[N24]</a> a higher progress of development, carried out in
real existence, only during a later period, even if he had never seen
the later ones; for in such types the germs of a future development
may be recognised, and upon close examination, truly referred to
the peculiarities of other higher groups, even if the intermediate
links remained unknown, which, however, as the matter now stands,
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>can leave no doubt in our mind that these prophetic types really foreshadowed
that diversity of forms which has been created since they
have gone by. We may also say that these prophetic types lay before
us the course of thoughts which has been carried out in the plan
of creation by the Supreme intelligence, who called them into existence
in rich order of succession, and in so diversified relations. The
recognition of this prophetic character of certain types of extinct animals
is not only important in a philosophical point of view; I have
no doubt it will ultimately and rapidly lead to a better, fuller, higher,
and deeper understanding of the various relations which exist
between animals. Let me at once point to some of these relations
which might never have been understood but for this appreciation.</p>

<p>Among Crinoids, we have not only progressive types, as I have
already quoted, but we have also prophetic ones. The Cystidæ are
truly prophetic of the Echini proper. I may only mention the genus
Echinocrinus to shew the link.</p>

<p>The Pentremites, again, are the prophetic type foreshadowing the
star-fishes. And often in subordinate groups we may find such close
relations between genera of the same minor divisions; such, for instance,
as the genus Encrinus, in which the genera Apiocrinus and
Pentacrinus, are simultaneously foreshadowed. Perhaps, in this
case, a distinction might be introduced between truly prophetic types
and synthetic types, in which the characters of later groups are
rather more combined than really foreshadowed.</p>

<p>As for the relation between older types and the embryos of the
living representatives of the same families which are so extensively
observed in almost all groups of the animal kingdom, which have
existed during earlier periods, it may best be expressed if we call
those fossils which exemplify, in full grown animals, forms which
exist at present only in the earliest stages of growth of our living
animals, <i>Embryonic Types</i>, in counterdistinction from the progressive
types, and from the prophetic types. These embryonic types may
be purely such, or they may be at the same time either progressive
types, or even prophetic types. I shall call purely embryonic types
those in which we recognise peculiarities characteristic of the embryo
of the same family. For instance, the older Sauroids, which
have the upper lobe of the tail prolonged, or the common Crinoids
provided with a stem, which resemble the young Comatulæ, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
I shall distinguish, as progressive embryonic types, those in which
we recognise simultaneously a relation to the embryo of the same
family, when they form besides a link in the natural chain of progressive
development. Such, for instance, as the oldest Salamanders,
or the earliest Sirenoid Pachyderm. Finally, I shall call prophetic
embryonic types those in which we have embryonic characters, combined
with the peculiarities which stamp the type as a prophetic one,
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>such, for instance, as the Echinoid and Asteroid Crinoids of the former
ages.</p>

<p>The fact that these different types may thus present complications
of their character, or appear more or less pure and typical, goes
further to shew how deeply diversified the plan of creation is, and
how many relations should be simultaneously understood before we
are prepared to have a full insight into the plan of creation. There
we see one type forming simply, and alone, the first link of a progressive
series. There we see another which foreshadows types, which
appear isolate afterwards. There we see a third, which, in its full
development, exemplifies a state which is transient only in higher
representatives of the same family. And then, again, we see these
different relations running into each other, and reminding us that,
however difficult it may be for us to see at one glance all this diversity
of relations, there is, notwithstanding, an intelligence which not only
conceived these various combinations, but called them into real existence
in a long succession of ages.&mdash;<cite>L. Agassiz in the American

<cite>On a new Analogy in the Periods of Rotation of the Primary
Planets discovered by Daniel Kirkwood of Pottsville, Pennsylvania.</cite></h3>

<p class="p2">At the recent meeting of the Association for the Advancement of
Science, an announcement was made, which, if it is found to be correct,
will be regarded as relating to one of the most important discoveries
which have been made in astronomy for years. It is no less
than a new law of the solar system, closely resembling those of Kepler,
which form the groundwork of many of the problems of astronomy.
Mr S. C. Walker read to the Association a letter from Mr Daniel
Kirkwood, of Pottsville, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr>, the discoverer of this new law, from
which we make some extracts, omitting all that refers to the higher
branches of mathematics.</p>

<p><q>While we have in the law of Kepler a bond of mutual relationship
between the planets, as regards their revolutions around the
sun, it is remarkable that no law regulating their rotations on their
axes has ever been discovered. For several years I have had little
doubt of the existence of such a law in nature, and have been engaged,
as circumstances would permit, in attempting its development.
I have at length arrived at results, which, if they do not justify me
in announcing the solution of this important and interesting problem,
must at least be regarded as astonishing coincidences.</q></p>

<p>From these data he deduces the following law:&mdash;<q>The square of

<p>"It will be seen from the above, that the diameter of the earth's

the respective spheres of attraction of the other planets, according to
my empirical<a name= "fnanchor_N25" id= "fnanchor_N25"></a><a href= "#footnote_N25" class= "fnanchor">[N25]</a> law, will be found to be as follows:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><q>The volumes of the sphere of attraction of Venus, Mars, and
Saturn in this table, correspond with those obtained from the preceding
one; that of Mars extending 61,000,000 miles beyond his
orbit, or to the distance of 206,000,000 miles from the sun. This
is about 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 miles less than the mean distance
of Flora, the nearest discovered asteroid. That of Mercury extends
about 11,000,000 miles within the orbit; consequently, if there be
an undiscovered planet interior to Mercury, its distance from the
Sun, according to my hypothesis, must be less than 26,000,000
miles. Jupiter's sphere of attraction extends only about 200,000,000
of miles within his orbit, and leaving 89,000,000 miles for the
asteroids. It is only in the most distant portion of this space, where
small bodies would be likely to be detected, that none have yet been
discovered.</q></p>

<p><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>Mr Kirkwood then modestly concludes:<span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><q>The foregoing is submitted to your inspection with much diffidence.
An author, you know, can hardly be expected to form a
proper estimate of his own performance. When it is considered,
however, that my formula involves the distances, masses, annual revolutions,
and axial rotations of all the primary planets in the system,
I must confess I find it difficult to resist the conclusion, that
the law is founded in nature.</q></p>

<p>After this letter had been read, Mr Walker said, that, induced by
the importance of the subject, he had at once proceeded to verify
the data and conclusions of Mr Kirkwood, and had found that there
was nothing in them requiring modification, except, perhaps, the
substitution of some more recent values for the masses of Mercury
and Uranus. This theory and that of Laplace, with reference to
nebulæ, mutually strengthen each other; although the latter has
been a mere supposition, while the former rests upon a mathematical
basis. In a later letter, which was also read, Mr Kirkwood says
that he has pursued this subject for the last ten years, it having
been first suggested to him by the nebular hypothesis, which he
thought could be established by some law of rotation.</p>

<p>Mr Walker then entered into a lengthened examination of the data
on which the law rests, and seemed to come to the conclusion, that,
as far as we know at present, everything is in favour of the truth of
the law, except that it requires the assumption of another planet between
Jupiter and Mars.</p>

<p>Mr Walker closed his examination by saying, "We may, therefore,
conclude, that, <em>whether Kirkwood's analogy is or is not the expression
of a physical law, it is, at least, that of a physical fact in
the mechanism of the universe</em>. The quantity on which the analogy
is based has such immediate dependence upon the nebular hypothesis,
that it lends strength to the latter, and gives new plausibility to the
presumption that this, also, is a fact in the past history of the solar
system.</p>

<p>"Such, then, is the present state of the question. Thirty-six
elements of nine planets (four being hypothetical) appear to harmonize
with Kirkwood's analogy in all the four fundamental equations
of condition for each planet.</p>

<p>"To suppose that so many independent variable quantities should
harmonize together by accident, is a more strained construction of
the premises than the frank admission that they follow a law of
nature.</p>

<p>"If, in the course of time, the hypotheses of Laplace and Kirkwood
should be found to be the laws of nature, they will throw new
light on the internal organization of the planets in their present,
and in any more primitive, state through which they may have
passed.</p>

<p>"For instance, we may compute the distance from the centre at
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>which any planet must have received its projectile force, in order to
produce, at the same time, its double movement of translation and
rotation.</p>

<p>"If the planet, in a more primitive state, existed in the form of
a ring revolving round the Sun, having its present orbit for that of
the centre of gravity of the ring, the momentum of rotation must, by
virtue of the principle of conservation of movement, have existed in
some form in the ring. It is easy to perceive that this momentum
is precisely the amount which must be distributed among the particles
of the ring, in order to preserve to all the condition of dynamical
equilibrium, while those of each generating surface of the ring
were wheeling round with the same angular velocity.</p>

<p>"If the planets have really passed from the shape of a revolving
ring to their present state, the prevalence of Kirkwood's analogy
shews a nice adaptation of parts in every stage of the transition.</p>

<p>"If the primitive quantity of coloric (free and latent) had undergone
a very great change beyond that now indicated in the cooling
of their crusts; if the primitive quantity of movement of rotation
had been different from its actual value for any planet; if the law of
elasticity of particles for a given temperature and distance from each
other varied from one planet to another in the primitive or present
state; in either of these cases, the analogy of Kirkwood might have
failed. As it is, no such failure is noticed; we are authorised, therefore,
to conclude, that the primitive quantity of coloric, the law of
elasticity, the quantity of movement of rotation, the past and present
radii of percussion, the primitive diameter of the generating surface
of the rings, and the present dimensions and density of the planets,
have been regulated by a general law, which has fulfilled for all of
them the four fundamental conditions of Kirkwood's hypothesis<a name= "fnanchor_N26" id= "fnanchor_N26"></a><a href= "#footnote_N26" class= "fnanchor">[N26]</a>.</p>

<p><q>We may extend the nebular hypothesis and Kirkwood's analogy
to the secondary system. If they are laws of nature, they must
apply to both. In the secondary systems, the day and month are
the same. This fact has remained hitherto unexplained. Lagrange
shewed that if these values were once nearly equal, a libration sets
in round a state of perfect equality; but he offered no conjecture as
to the cause of the primitive equality. On the nebular and Kirkwood's
hypothesis, it would only be necessary that, upon the breaking
up of the ring, the primitive diameter of the generating figure
and law of relative density of layers should be preserved.</q></p>

<p>Professor Peirce, whose opinions will probably be regarded as of
more value on such a subject than that of any other man in this
country,&mdash;especially since his successful discussion with Leverrier,&mdash;remarked,
that Kirkwood's analogy was the only discovery of the
kind since Kepler's time that approached near to the character of
his three physical laws. Bode's law, so called, was at best only an
imperfect analogy. Kirkwood's analogy was more comprehensive,
and more in harmony with the known elements of the system. The
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>diameter of the sphere of attraction, a fundamental element in this
analogy, now for the first time gave an appearance of reality to
Laplace's nebular hypothesis which it never had before. The positive
testimony in its favour would now outweigh the former negative
evidence in the case, however strong it may have been. It follows
at least from Kirkwood's analogy, that the planets were dependent
upon each other, and therefore connected in their origin, whatever
may have been the form of the connection, whether that of the nebular
hypothesis, or some other not yet imagined.</p>

<p>At a later period of the meeting, M. B. A. Gould junior, stated
that he had gone through the necessary calculations, using different
quantities, and had come to the same conclusions as Mr Walker.
He expressed his opinion, that at some future day the world will
<q>speak of Kepler and Kirkwood as the discoverers of great planetary
laws.</q></p>

<p>The members generally expressed the opinion, that Laplace's
nebular hypothesis, from its furnishing one of the elements of Kirkwood's
law, may now be regarded as an established fact in the past
history of the solar system.&mdash;<cite>American Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 335.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Such, at least, is rather a representation of American
opinions than of our own. We are inclined to compare it more with
Bode's law than with Kepler's. The former is a mere arithmetical
accident, applying indifferently well to a portion only of the planets,
and having nothing of reason to advance for its establishment. The
latter are essential parts of mechanics and gravitation, and precisely
and perfectly, and necessarily true, not only in every part of the
solar system, but through the whole universe.</p>

<p>The fact of axial rotations being the groundwork of Kirkwood's
analogy seems fatal to it, for gravitation takes no more account of
the time of rotation of a planet than it does of specific gravity; all
calculations of the movement of the body in space are equally independent
of the one and the other.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the degree of accuracy with which it
may be found to apply is the only saving clause. Messrs Walker
and Gould investigating the subject independently, and with better
constants of mass and distance than Kirkwood had been able to procure,
declare that it appears <em>perfectly</em>! We are sorry that the late
hour at which we have received this paper has prevented us either
from giving it in full, or from testing the theory rigidly.</p>

<p>It will be observed that, according to Kirkwood's theory, in order
to compute the time of axial rotations of any planet, it is necessary
to have its mass and mean distance, together with the same quantities
for the planets on either side of it. Now, these quantities are
only obtainable for Venus, the Earth, Saturn, and Uranus (a planet
being lost between Mars and Jupiter); and the rotation of Uranus
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>not having been obtained as yet, there remains only the three first
by which the theory can be tested.</p>

<p>In a preliminary calculation which we have instituted, we do not
find the results so accordant as we had been led to expect, but
still sufficiently so to give a certain probability of the approach to
truth, in a case where the quantity had not been observed.</p>

<p>Viewed in this light, some very interesting results are obtained.

<i>1st</i>, The idea entertained by Bianchini and other observers, that
the rotation of Venus is nearly 24 times as long as hitherto supposed,
is utterly untenable.</p>

<p><i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>, The time of rotation of Uranus, a quantity never yet observed
(but doubtless capable of being observed by a telescope of Lord
Rosse's calibre, <em>removed to a table-land in a tropical country</em>) is
given; and appears so very different from any other yet observed,
especially so from those of its neighbours Saturn and Jupiter, being
= 1·396779, earth's = 0·997270 (sidereal rotation in mean
solar days.)</p>

<p><i><abbr title="third">3d</abbr></i>, Knowing the rotations of Jupiter and Mars, we may supply,
by using the analogy conversely, the <em>diameters of their spheres of
attraction</em>, and thus get at the elements of the lost planet between Mars
and Jupiter, and these appear<a name= "fnanchor_N36" id= "fnanchor_N36"></a><a href= "#footnote_N36" class= "fnanchor">[N36]</a> to be:&mdash;mean distance = 2·9085111
(earth unity), mass in terms of Sun 1/1353240, sidereal rotation in
earth's mean solar days 2·406104, and diameter of sphere of attraction
0·830951, in terms of earth's distance. The size is thus a little
larger than Mars. The slowness of rotation is remarkable, especially
in the case of a planet which is supposed since to have burst into
pieces: the Americans have called it Kirkwood.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="Art_17-M"></a>METEOROLOGY.</p>

<p>1. <i>Use of Coloured Glasses to assist the View in Fogs.</i>&mdash;M.
Lavini of Turin, in a letter to the editor of <i lang="fr">L'Institut</i> at Paris, makes
the following curious observation, which, if confirmed, may prove to
be of great importance:&mdash;<q>When there is a fog between two corresponding
stations, so that the one station can with difficulty be seen
from the other, if the observer passes a coloured glass between his
eye and the eye-piece of his telescope, the effect of the fog is very
sensibly diminished, so that frequently the signals from the other
station can be very plainly perceived; when, without the coloured
glass, even the station itself is invisible. The different colours do
not all produce this effect in the same degree, the red seeming to be
the best. Those who have good sight prefer the dark-red, while
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>those who are short-sighted like the light-red better. The explanation
of this effect seems to depend upon the fact, that the white
colour of the fog strikes too powerfully upon the organ of sight,
especially if the glass have a somewhat large field. But by the insertion
of the coloured glass, the intensity of the light is much diminished
by the interception of a part of the rays, and the observer's
eye is less wearied, and, consequently, distinguishes better the outlines
of the object observed.</q></p>

<p>2. <i>Ozone.</i>&mdash;Chemists are not yet fully agreed concerning the
nature or production of this singular substance, ozone. To Schonbein
and Williamson we are indebted for most of our knowledge concerning
it. The latter has supposed it to be a compound of oxygen
and hydrogen, from the fact, that, when the ozone completely freed
from moisture was passed over ignited copper, water was produced.
De la Rive produced it by passing a current of electricity through
pure dry oxygen gas contained in a receiver. It is also obtained in
large quantities by passing oxygen gas over moistened phosphorous,
and afterwards drying it. Thus prepared, it is a powerful chemical
agent, possesses bleaching properties, oxidises the metals with rapidity,
and destroys India-rubber. The hydrogen acids of sulphur are
decomposed by it, water being formed by uniting with the hydrogen
of the acid, and sulphur being set free. Professor Horsford has observed
that ozone, subjected to a heat of 130° Fah., entirely loses
its properties. Ozone, like chlorine, precipitates iodine, colouring
a solution of iodide of potassium, and starch a deep blue colour.
The peculiar smell, prevalent in the vicinity of objects struck by
lightning, as well as that occasioned by the excitation of an electrical
machine, and by the striking of two pieces of silica together, it is believed
to be occasioned by ozone.&mdash;<i>Editors.</i>&mdash;<cite>Annual of Scientific
Discovery</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 219.</p>

<p><i>Method of Determining the Amount of Ozone in the Atmosphere.</i>&mdash;At
the meeting of the American Association, an instrument for
determining the relative quantity of ozone in the air was presented
by Professor Horsford. It consisted of a tube, containing at one
end a plug of asbestus, moistened with a solution of iodide of potassium
and starch. This plug within the tube, attached to an aspirator,
would, as air passed over it, become blue. If much water
flowed from the aspirator, and of course much air flowed over the
asbestus before it became blue, the quantity of ozone indicated would
be small. If but little water flowed (and this could be measured),
the quantity of ozone indicated would be greater. The quantities
of ozone would be inversely as the volumes of air passing through
the tube before blueness is produced.&mdash;<cite>Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>,

<p>3. <i>On the Phenomena of the Rise and Fall of the Waters of the
Northern Lakes of America.</i>&mdash;At a meeting of the American Academy,
February 1849, Mr Foster, of the United States Mineral
Survey in the North-west Territory, presented the result of some observations,
undertaken with a view of determining whether the waters
of the northern lakes are subject to any movements corresponding to
tidal action. The result of these observations had convinced him
that these waters do not rise and fall at stated periods, corresponding
to the ebb and flow of the tide, but are subject to extraordinary
risings, which are independent of the influence of the sun and moon.
These risings attracted the attention of the earliest <i lang="fr">voyageurs</i> in
these regions. Charlevoix, who traversed the lakes nearly a century
ago, says, in reference to Lake Ontario:&mdash;<q>I observed that in this
lake there is a sort of reflux and flux almost instantaneous; the
rocks near the banks being covered with water, and uncovered again
several times in the space of a quarter of an hour, even if the surface
of the lake was very calm, with scarce a breath of air. After
reflecting some time on this appearance, <em>I imagined it was owing to
springs at the bottom of the lake, and to the shock of their currents
with those of the rivers which fall into them from all sides, and
thus produce those intermitting motions</em>.</q> The same movements
were noticed by Mackenzie in 1789; by an expedition under Colonel
Bradstreet in 1764; on Lake Erie in 1823, and at various later
periods. In the summer of 1834, an extraordinary retrocession of
the waters of Lake Superior took place at the outlet of Sault St Marie.
The river at this place is nearly a mile wide, and in the distance of
a mile falls 18·5 feet. The phenomena occurred about noon. The
day was calm, but cloudy. The water retired suddenly, leaving the
bed of the river bare, except for a distance of thirty rods, and remained
so for nearly an hour. Persons went out and caught fish
in pools formed in the depressions of the rocks. The return of the
waters is represented as having been very grand. They came down
like an immense surge, and so sudden was it, that those engaged in
catching fish had barely time to escape being overwhelmed. In the
summer of 1847, on one occasion the water rose and fell at intervals of
about fifteen minutes during an entire afternoon. The variation was
from twelve to twenty inches, the day being calm and clear; but the
barometer was falling. Before the expiration of forty-eight hours,
a violent gale set in. At Copper harbour, the ebb and flow of the
water through narrow inlets and estuaries has been repeatedly noticed
when there was not a breath of wind on the lake. Similar phenomena
occur on several of the Swiss lakes. Professor Mather, who
observed the barometer at Copper harbour during one of these fluctuations,
remarks:&mdash;<q>As a general thing, fluctuations in the barometer
accompanied fluctuations in the level of the water; but sometimes
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span>the water-level varied rapidly in the harbour, while no such
variations occurred in the barometer at the place of observation.</q></p>

<p>As a general rule, these variations in the water-level indicate the
approach of a storm, or a disturbed state of the atmosphere. The
barometer is not sufficiently sensitive to indicate the sudden elevations
and depressions, recurring, as they often do, at intervals of ten
or twelve minutes; and the result of observations at such time may,
in some degree, be regarded as negative. Besides, it may not unfrequently
happen, that, while effects are witnessed at the place of
observation, the cause which produced them may be so far removed
as not to influence the barometer. We are, therefore, led to infer
that these phenomena result, not from the prevalence of the winds
acting on the water, accumulating it at one point and depressing it at
others, but from sudden and local changes in the pressure of the atmosphere,
giving rise to a series of barometric waves. The water,
conforming to the laws which govern two fluids thus relatively situated,
would accumulate where the pressure was the least, and be displaced
where it was the greatest. It has been remarked by De la
Beche, that a sudden impulse given to the particles of water, either by
a suddenly increased or diminished pressure, would cause a perpendicular
rise or fall, in the manner of a wave, beyond the height or
depth strictly due to the mere weight itself. The difference in the
specific gravity of the water of the lakes and the ocean may cause
these changes to be more marked in the former than in the latter.&mdash;<cite>American
Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 245.</p>

<p>4. <i>Water Thermometer.</i>&mdash;Lieut. Maury states that he has been
very much assisted in developing his theory of winds and currents by
means of the thermometer used by some vessels for determining the
temperature of the water. It was by means of these observations
on the temperature of the water that he was enabled to prove that,
off the shores of South America, between the parallels of 35° and
40° south, there is a region of the ocean in which the temperature
is as high as that of our own Gulf stream, while in the middle of
the ocean, and between the same parallels, the temperature of the
water is not so great by 22°. Now, this very region is noted for
its gales, being the most stormy that the as yet incomplete charts of
the South Atlantic indicate. Lieut. Maury says, however, that
very few navigators make use of the water thermometer, so that he
has experienced some inconvenience in his undertaking. He is the
more surprised at this, from the fact that New York owes much of
her commercial importance to a discovery that was made by this
thermometer. At the time when Dr Franklin discovered the Gulf
Stream, Charleston had more foreign trade than New York and all
the New England States together. Charleston was then the half-way
house between New and Old England. When a vessel, in attempting
to enter the Delaware or Sandy Hook, met a north-west
gale or snow storm, as at certain seasons she is apt to do, instead of
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span>running off for a few hours into the Gulf Stream to thaw and get
warm, as she now does, she used to put off for Charleston or the
West Indies, and there remained till the return of spring before
making another attempt. A beautiful instance this of the importance
and bearings of a single fact, elicited by science from the works
of nature.&mdash;<cite>Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 160.</p>

<p>5. <i>On the Falls of Niagara.</i>&mdash;If we follow the chasm cut by the
Niagara river, down to Lake Ontario, we have a succession of strata
coming to the surface of various character and formation. These
strata dip south-west or towards the Falls, so that, in their progress
to their present position, the Falls have had a bed of very various
consistency. Some of these strata, as the shales and medina sandstone,
are very soft, and, when they formed the edge of the Fall, it probably
had the character of rapids; but, wherever it comes to an edge
of hard rock, with softer rock-beds below, the softer beds, crumbling
away, leave a shelf projecting above, and then the fall is perpendicular.
Such is the case at present; the hard Niagara limestone
overhangs in <em>tables</em> the soft shales underneath, which at last are
worn away to such an extent as to undermine the superincumbent
rocks. Such was also the case at Queenston, where the Clinton
group formed the edge, with the medina sandstone below. This
process has continued from the time when the Niagara fell directly
into Lake Ontario to the present time, and will continue so long as
there are soft beds underneath hard ones; but, from the inclination
of the strata, this will not always be the case. A time will come
when the rock below will also be hard. Then, probably, the Falls
will be nearly stationary, and may lose much of their beauty from
the wearing away of the edge rendering it an inclined plane. I do
not think the waters of Lake Erie will ever fall into Lake Ontario
without any intermediate cascade. The Niagara shales are so extensive
that possibly, at some future time, the river below the cascade
may be enlarged into a lake, and thus the force of the falling
water diminished; but the whole process is so slow, that no accurate
calculations can be made. The Falls were probably larger, and
stationary for a longer time at the <q>Whirlpool</q> than anywhere else.
At that point there was no division of the cataract, but at the
<q>Devil's Hole</q> there are indications of a lateral fall, probably
similar to what is now called the American Fall. At the Whirlpool,
the rocks are still united beneath the water, shewing that they
were once continuous above its surface also.<a name= "fnanchor_89" id= "fnanchor_89"></a><a href= "#footnote_89" class= "fnanchor">[89]</a>&mdash;<cite>Agassiz on Lake

the American Academy, in January 1849, Dr Charles T. Jackson
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>stated that he had discovered the presence of manganese in the water
of streams, lakes, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, almost universally. He detected it in water
from the middle of Lake Superior, in Cochituate water, and in water
from various sources. It has usually been regarded as iron in previous
analyses. He considered the observation as having an important
bearing in accounting for the deposits of bog manganese at the
outlets of ponds, lakes, and in bogs, as well as for the source of the
oxide of manganese in the blood.&mdash;<cite>Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>,

<p><i>On the Presence of Organic Matter in Water.</i>&mdash;The following
facts relative to the presence of organic matter in water were presented
to the British Association, by Professor Forchhammer, as the
result of extended observations on the water, near Copenhagen.</p>

<p><i>1st</i>, The quantity of organic matter in water is greatest in summer.
<i><abbr title="second">2d</abbr></i>, It disappears, for the most part, as soon as the water
freezes. <i><abbr title="third">3d</abbr></i>, Its quantity is diminished by rain. <i>4th</i>, Its quantity
is diminished if the water has to run a long way in open channels.
The hypermanganate of potash or soda is recommended by the Professor
as a most excellent test for the presence of organic matter in
water.</p>

<p class="moreafter">7. <i>Arsenic in Chalybeate Springs.</i>&mdash;Since the discovery of
arsenic in the deposits from certain chalybeate springs, it has been
asked whether the poisonous properties of this substance are not
neutralized by the state in which it is found. M. Lassaigne has
finished a series of experiments connected with this subject, for the
purpose of ascertaining the proportion of arsenic contained, in what
state of combination it exists, and the nature of the action which
these arseniferous deposits exert in the animal economy. The following
are M. Lassaigne's conclusions:&mdash;1. In the natural deposits
of the mineral waters of Wattviller, arsenic exists to the amount of
2·8 per cent. 2. A portion of these deposits, representing 1·76
grains of arsenic acid, or 1·14 grains of arsenic, produced no effect
upon the health of a dog. 3. This non-action shews that the poisonous
property of the arsenic is destroyed by its combination with the
peroxide of iron, and thus confirms what has been before asserted,
that peroxide of iron, by combining with arsenious<a name= "fnanchor_N27" id= "fnanchor_N27"></a><a href= "#footnote_N27" class= "fnanchor">[N27]</a> and arsenic acid,
destroys their poisonous properties, and consequently becomes an
antidote for them.</p>

<p>8. <i>The Coal Formation of America.</i>&mdash;The coal regions of America
are, from the explorations which have thus far been made, supposed to
be divided into three principal masses; the great central tract, extending
from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to the west of Pennsylvania, and
being apparently continued to New Brunswick and Nova<a name= "fnanchor_N28" id= "fnanchor_N28"></a><a href= "#footnote_N28" class= "fnanchor">[N28]</a> Scotia;
the second tract strikes north-westward from Kentucky, crosses the
Ohio, and stretches through Illinois to the Mississippi River; a third
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>region, smaller than the others, lies between the three great lakes&mdash;Erie,
Huron, and Michigan. Competent geologists affirm that, from
a comparison of the coal strata of contiguous basins, these are no
more than detached parts of a once continuous deposit.</p>

<p>The extent of this enormous coal field is, in length, from north-east
to south-west, more than 720 miles, and its greatest breadth
about 180 miles; its area, upon a moderate calculation, amounts to
63,000 square miles! In addition to these, there are several detached
tracts of anthracite in Eastern Pennsylvania, which form some
of the most remarkable coal tracts in the world. They occupy an
area of about 200 square miles.</p>

<p>The strata which constitute this vast deposit comprehend nearly
all the known varieties of coal, from the dryest and most compact
anthracite to the most fusible and combustible common coal. One
of the most remarkable features of these coal-seams is their prodigious
bulk. The great bed of Pittsburgh<a name= "fnanchor_N29" id= "fnanchor_N29"></a><a href= "#footnote_N29" class= "fnanchor">[N29]</a>, extending nearly the entire
length of the Monongahela River, has been traced through a great
elliptic area, of nearly 225 miles in its longest diameter, and of the
maximum breadth of about 100 miles, the superficial extent being
14,000 square miles, the thickness of the bed diminishing gradually
from 12 or 14 feet to 2 feet. In 1847 the anthracite coal regions
of Pennsylvania furnished 3,000,000 tons, and 11,439 vessels cleared
from Philadelphia in that year, loaded with the article. The produce
in 1848 and the present year, is of course larger.</p>

<p>The bituminous coal area of the United States is 133,132 square
miles, or one 17th part of the whole. The bituminous coal area of
British America is 18,000 square miles, or one 45th part; Great
Britain, 8139 square miles; Spain, 3408 square miles, or one 52d
part; France, 1719 square miles, or one 118th part; and Belgium,
518 square miles, or one 122d part. The area of the Pennsylvania
anthracite coal formations is put down at 437 square miles; and that
of Great Britain and Ireland anthracite and culm, at 3720 square
miles. The anthracite coal of Great Britain and Ireland, however,
is not nearly so valuable an article of fuel as the anthracite coal of
Pennsylvania, nor does a given area yield so much as the latter.&mdash;<cite>New

<p>9. <i>River Terraces of the Connecticut Valley.</i>&mdash;At the meeting
of the American Association in August, President Hitchcock of
Amherst College, read a paper <q>On the River Terraces of the Connecticut
Valley, and on the Erosions of the Earth's Surface.</q> He
stated that his paper must be considered as containing a few facts
and suggestions and not a finished theory. He has examined the
valley from its mouth to Turner's Falls, and carefully measured the
heights of the terraces. "As you approach the river you find plains
of sand, gravel, or loam, terminated by a slope sometimes as steep
as 35°, and a second plain, then another slope and another plain,
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>and so on, sometimes to a great number. I find that these terraces
occur in successive basins, formed by the approaches of the mountains
upon the banks at intervals. Sometimes the basin will be 15
or 20 miles in width, but usually much narrower; and it is upon
the margins of these basins that the terraces are formed. I have
rarely found terraces more than 200 feet above the river, which
would be in Massachusetts, about 300 feet above the ocean, and at
Hanover, <abbr title="New Hampshire">N.H.</abbr>,<a name= "fnanchor_N30" id= "fnanchor_N30"></a><a href= "#footnote_N30" class= "fnanchor">[N30]</a> about 560 feet. Nowhere do they exist along any
river, unless that river has basins. As to the materials of which
they are formed they appear exceedingly artificial. The outer or
highest terrace is generally composed of coarser materials than the
inner ones. They are all composed of materials which are worn
from the rocks, but the outer terrace oftener is full of pebbles, some
of them as large as 12 inches, while the materials of the inner seem
reduced to an impalpable powder, like the soil of a meadow which is
overflowed during high water. Whence did these materials originate?
The materials were first worn from solid rocks, and afterwards
brought into these valleys. The outer terrace appears to have
been often in part the result of the drift agency. Afterwards, the
river agency sorted the materials, and gave them a level surface, the
successive basins having at that time barriers. The inner terrace
appears to have been, at least in its upper part, the result of deposition
from the river itself.</p>

<p><q>I will now mention a few facts which I have observed. The
terraces do not generally agree in height upon the opposite sides of
the valley. The higher ones oftener agree, perhaps, than the lower
ones. If formed, as I suppose, from the rivers, we should expect
this. The terraces slope downwards in the direction of the stream.
The same terrace which, near South Hadley, is 190 feet above the
river, slopes until, at East Hartford, it is only 40 feet above the
river, thus sloping 150 feet more than the slope of the river
itself, in a distance of 40 or 50 miles. This shows that they
could not have been formed by the sea or by a lake, for they would
then have been horizontal. The greatest number of terraces observed
is eight or nine. Generally there are but two or three.</q>
President Hitchcock then gives his view of the precise mode in which
these terraces were formed, illustrating them by references to other
parts of our country, and concludes by a notice of the erosions of the
earth's surface.&mdash;<cite>Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>, 1850, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 229.</p>

American Association, 1849, a paper on the fossil crinoids of Tennessee,
by Professor Troost, was read by Professor Agassiz.<a name= "fnanchor_90" id= "fnanchor_90"></a><a href= "#footnote_90" class= "fnanchor">[90]</a> The
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>species embraced are not less than eighty-eight in number, of which
only half a dozen have been described. It is the opinion of Professor
Hall that all the silurian formations of New York, previous to the beginning
of the geological survey, did not afford more than four or five.
Now, about sixty species have been ascertained. Professor Hall mentioned
the fact, that all the crinoids of the lower silurian rocks, with
the exception of one species, have five pelvic plates, and we never find
one with three, or any other number of these plates, before we reach
the highest deposits. In Tennessee, the crinoids are so abundant,
that Professor Troost states that he had been able to collect some
300 or 400 good specimens of seven or eight different species in a
single morning. In relation to the abundance of these fossils in the
United States, Professor Agassiz remarked, that it is not, perhaps,
sufficiently appreciated of what importance, and of what immense
value the study of these fossil crinoids may be for the progress of
palæontology. American students should be proud of these materials,
by which they will be able to throw so much light upon these
almost extinct families by their personal investigations, which will
not only render them independent of the palæontologist from abroad
for information with regard to the succession of types, and the full
illustration of these structures, but really afford correct standards for
comparison. It is the more desirable that all these fossils should be
made known, as the family of crinoids is so reduced in our days
that we can form no idea of the living animals of that group, of their
diversity of form, modification of character, and peculiarity of position,
from the living type only. He doubted whether the number
of crinoid heads of all species found in Europe, now existing in the
Museums of Europe, is one-third the number of those which have
been found by a single gentleman in Tennessee in one morning.
Now, with such materials, consider what precise and what minute
investigations could be made. And if these facts could be once fully
ascertained and well illustrated, there is no doubt that the series of
crinoids, and their succession in former ages, will be established from
American standards, and will no longer rest upon the European evidence,
which has often been derived from the examination of small
fragments of those ancient fossils, found in unconnected basins for
the most part, so that their geological succession could be ascertained
only with great doubt and difficulty. In conclusion, Professor
Agassiz would venture to say, that geologists who have had any opportunity
to compare the position of the ancient rocks on this continent
of North America with the corresponding deposits of Europe, would
agree with him in saying that the geology proper, the stratography
of North America, will afford the same precise and well authenticated
standards for the appreciation of the order of succession of rocks,
as fossils will for the order of succession of living beings.&mdash;<cite>American

<p><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>11. <i>Discovery of Coral Animals on the Coast of Massachusetts.</i>&mdash;Professor
Agassiz, while on an expedition in one of the vessels of
the coast survey during the past summer, obtained by means of a
dredge, from a depth of seventy-two feet, in the Vineyard Sound off
Gay Head, several specimens of a coral with its animals. By great
care and attention they were preserved alive in glass jars for more
than six weeks, and afforded an excellent opportunity for an examination
and observation of their structure and habits. These
corals belong to the genus <i>Astrangia</i>, and have been named by
Professor Agassiz, in honour of Professor Dana, geologist of the
exploring expedition, Astrangia Dana.</p>

<p>This species presents two varieties. Some are of a pink or rose
colour, others are white. The general form of the animal is a cylinder
(as of all Polypi) resting on its base, and expanded on the upper
margin; thus expanded it is about two lines in diameter. The
number of tentacles is definite, but it is not always the same absolute
number. It never exceeds twenty-four; in earlier periods of
life there are only twelve, and there is even an epoch when there
are only six.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, a matter of surprise that the coral animal should
have been found in this latitude. They teem in the warm latitudes;
but there are very few species in the more temperate regions, and
but for the opportunity afforded by the coast survey, the existence
of these animals could not have been suspected on these shores.
For many years, however, dead fragments had been found along
the shores; but whether they lived there naturally or not had
not been ascertained.&mdash;<cite>American Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 311.</p>

<p>12. <i>On the Circulation and Digestion of the Lower Animals.</i>&mdash;Professor
Agassiz states, that the circulation of the invertebrata cannot
be compared to that of the vertebrata. Instead of the three conditions
of chyme, chyle, and blood, which the circulating fluid of the
vertebrata undergoes, the blood of that class of the invertebrata
which he had particularly studied, the annelida or worms, is simple
coloured chyle. The receptacles of chyle in different parts of the
body are true lymphatic hearts, like those found in the vertebrata;
this kind of circulation is found in the articulata and mollusks, with
few exceptions, and in some of the echinoderms. In the medusæ
and polyps, instead of chyle, chyme mixed with water is circulated;
this circulation is found in some mollusks and intestinal worms. Professor
Agassiz thinks, that the embryological development of the
higher animals shews a similar succession in the circulating function.
As regards the connection between respiration and circulation in vertebrata,
the gills are found between branches of the blood system; in
invertebrata, the chyliferous system is acted on by the respiration.
The gills of fishes, therefore, cannot be compared to the gills of crustacea,
articulata, and mollusks. In fact, no gills are connected with
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>the chymiferous circulation. Animals having this circulation, have no
true respiration. They have only tubes to distribute freshly aërated
water to different parts of the body.&mdash;<cite><abbr title="Procedings of the Boston Natural History Society">Proc. Bost. Nat. Hist. Soc.</abbr></cite></p>

<p>13. <i>Distribution of the Testaceous Mollusca of Jamaica.</i>&mdash;The
great number of species is remarkable. A few miles of coast, without
the aid of storms, and without dredging, yielded 450 species.
In the small bay of Port Royal, 350 marine species were found.
A pint of sand, taken from a surface three yards long, contained 110
species. Probably there are 350 or 400 specimens of land shells,
and two or three times as many of marine species. Extensive districts
occur, however, which are nearly destitute of land or marine
shells. They are accumulated in favourable stations.</p>

<p>The difference in the extent of the distribution of the marine and
of the terrestrial species is remarkable. A majority of the marine
species are known to occur in the other islands; probably not more
than 10 or 15 per cent. of them will be found to be peculiar to Jamaica.
But of the land shells, 95 per cent. are peculiar to the island. The
limited distribution of the terrestrial species is remarkable. A few
are generally distributed, but a large number are limited to districts
of a few miles in diameter; and several, although occurring
abundantly, could be found only within the space of a few rods.
Only seventeen fresh-water species were found. Favourable stations
for fresh-water species are rare.</p>

<p>In respect of the number of individuals of mollusca in Jamaica, as
compared with more northern latitudes, the rule so obvious in the
class of fishes is not applicable to the same extent. Of fishes, the
species are much more numerous, but individuals much less so. Of
the mollusca, the total number of individuals is about the same as
in this latitude, and the number of species represented by a profusion
of individuals is about the same. But the number of species not
occurring abundantly is much greater, so that the average of individuals
to all the species is less than in this latitude. From a comparison
of the laws of distribution of the marine and terrestrial
species in the Antilles, it follows that the number of the latter must
exceed that of the former. With the insular distribution of the terrestrial
species may be associated the fact, that the coral reefs are
all fringing, for both facts are connected with the geological fact,
that these islands are in a process of elevation.&mdash;Professor <span class="sc">Adams</span>
before the American Association.&mdash;<cite>American Annual of Scientific
Discovery</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 334.</p>

<p>14. <i>Metamorphoses of the Lepidoptera.</i>&mdash;Professor Agassiz said
that he had, during the past season, been studying the metamorphoses
of the Lepidoptera, and, to his great surprise, he had found
that one stage in the transformation of these insects has been overlooked
by naturalists. We knew the Lepidoptera in three conditions,&mdash;that
of the worm, furnished with jaws and jointed, the chrysalis,
and the perfect insect with four wings. The change not before
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>described, which he had noticed, is somewhat concealed under
the skin of the caterpillar. The animal at a certain period swells
at the thoracic<a name= "fnanchor_N31" id= "fnanchor_N31"></a><a href= "#footnote_N31" class= "fnanchor">[N31]</a> region, and becomes extremely sensitive to the touch
in this part, the skin being, in fact, in a state of inflammation. On
cutting open the skin at this place, Professor Agassiz found beneath
it a four-winged insect, before it had passed into the chrysalis state.
The wings were long enough to extend half the length of the perfect
insect. The posterior pair he found to be membraneous bags, somewhat
flattened, like the respiratory vesicles of marine worms, with
distinct ribs, which are blood-vessels. The anterior pair are also
bags, with their upper half stiff and inflexible, like the elytra of
coleoptera. The legs are tubular, but not joined, as in the perfect
insect. The jaws are changed into two long tubes, which are bent
backwards, as are also the antennæ. In the chrysalis, the wings
are flattened and soldered together, as are the legs and sucking-tubes,
which are bent backwards. The order of development of the different
parts and the coleopterous condition at an incomplete stage,
show that naturalists have been in error in placing chewing insects,
as the coleoptera, above the sucking insects. The order should be
reversed. Professor Agassiz said that he had confirmed his observations
in many specimens, by examining them just at the moment
when the skin begins to split on the back.&mdash;<cite>American Annual of
Scientific Discovery</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 327.</p>

<p>15. <i>On the Zoological Character of Young Mammalia.</i>&mdash;At the
meeting of the American Association for the Promotion of Science,
Professor Agassiz remarked, that zoologists have, in their investigations,
constantly neglected one side of their subject, which, when
properly considered, will throw a great amount of new light on their
investigations. Studying animals, in general, it has been the habit
to investigate them in their full grown condition, and scarcely ever
to look back for their characters in earlier periods of life. We scarcely
ever find, in a book of natural history, a hint as to the difference
which exists in the young and old. Perhaps in birds, the colour of
the young may be noticed; and it is generally known, that the young
resemble the female more than the male; but as to precise investigation
of the subject, we are deficient. But if the early stages of life
have been neglected, there is one period in the history of animals
which has been thoroughly investigated, for the last twenty-five years,&mdash;embryology.
The changes which take place within the egg itself,
and which give rise to the new individual, have been thoroughly examined;
but, after the formation of the new being, the changes in
its form which it passes through, up to its full grown condition, have
been neglected. It had been his object to investigate this subject,
because he had been struck with the deficiency there is on this point
in our works; and in making this investigation, he had found that
the young animals, in almost all classes, differ widely from what they
are in their full-grown condition. For instance, a young bat, a young
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>bird, or a young snake, at a certain period of their growth within the
egg, resemble each other so much, that he would defy the most able
zoologist of our day to distinguish between a robin and a bat, or
between a robin and a snake. There is something of high significance
in this fact. There is something common to all these. There
is a thought behind these material phenomena, which shews that
they are all combined under one rule, and that they only come under
different laws of development, to assume, finally, different shapes,
according to the object for which they were introduced.</p>

<p>There is a period of life, in which, whatever may be the final form
of their organs of locomotion, whatever may be the final difference
between the anterior and posterior extremities, vertebrated animals
have uniform legs, in the shape of little paddles or fins. This is the
case with lizards as well as birds. A robin's wing and a robin's leg,
which are so different from a bat's wing and a bat's leg, do not essentially
differ when young from the leg and arm of a bat. Wherever
we observe combined fingers preserving this condition, we have a
decided indication that such animals rank lower in the group to
which they belong. This is all-important, as we are enabled at once
to group animals which are otherwise allied, in a natural series, as
soon as we know whether they have combined or divided fingers.
And the degree of division to which the legs rise in their development
is a safe guide in our classification. Look, for instance, at the
legs of dogs and cats, in which the fingers are completely separated,
and so elongated, that the animals walk naturally upon tip-toe, and
compare them with others, bears, for instance, which walk upon the
whole sole of the foot; and, again, with those of seals or bats, which
remain united, and constitute either fins or a wing.</p>

<p>There are other reasons sufficient to convince us that the order
of arrangement which he had assigned them, according the development
of the fingers, is justified by the state of development of the
other organs of the mammalia, and especially of their higher organs
and intellectual faculties and instincts. And I will also add, says
Professor Agassiz, that mankind are not excluded from this connection,
but, in common with other vertebrata, we are all at one stage
of existence provided with paddles or fins, which are afterwards developed
into legs and arms.&mdash;<cite>American Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 324.</p>

<p>16. <i>The Manatus or Sea Cow, the Embryonic Type of the
Pachydermata?</i>&mdash;Professor Agassiz thinks that the Manati have
been improperly considered cetaceans: they differ from them in the
form of the skull, which is elongated, and in the position of the
nostrils, which are in front. On the other hand, the skull resembles
that of the elephant in front (particularly when seen from above), in
some of the details of the facial bones, which are not like those of
the cetacea, in the palatine bones, the arrangement of the teeth,
and in the curve of the lower jaw. Professor Agassiz, believed
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>this to be the true embryonic type of the Pachydermata<a name= "fnanchor_N32" id= "fnanchor_N32"></a><a href= "#footnote_N32" class= "fnanchor">[N32]</a>.&mdash;<cite>American
Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 313.</p>

<p>17. <i>Fossil Elephant and Mastodon from Africa.</i>&mdash;M. Gervais
communicated to the French Academy, on March 12th, that he had
just received from Algiers, a drawing of the molar tooth of a fossil
elephant, whose genus is very easily recognised, and which indicates
a species more resembling those found in a fossil state in Europe,
than the present African elephant. This tooth was found at Cherchell,
in the province of Oran. Sicily has hitherto been the southernmost
point on the Mediterranean where the fossil elephant has
been found.</p>

<p>At the same time, he also mentioned the discovery, near Constantine,
of some fossil remains of mastodons. Though fossil remains
of this animal have been previously found in all the other portions
of the world, these are the first discovered in Africa. The
remains found are a tooth and a rib, and, as far as can be judged
from a drawing, they belonged to an animal more resembling the
mastodon brevirostris, or the arvernensis, than the mastodon angustodens.&mdash;<cite>American
Journal of Scientific Discovery</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 287.</p>

<p>18. <i>Cauterization in the case of Poisonous Bites.</i>&mdash;In the <i lang="fr">Comptes
Rendus</i> for January 8th, we find an article by <abbr lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Parchappe, containing
the result of his observations on the question, whether the
spread of poison produced by a bite can be prevented by cauterizing.
He was induced to examine into this subject, because <abbr lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Renard had
stated that cauterization was found to have no effect when applied
even within five minutes after the bite in the cure of one sort of
virus, and within one hour in that of another. These results, he was
aware, though derived from experiments upon animals, would weaken
the confidence of physicians and patients in the only mode that
medicine possesses of preventing the bad effect of a bite from any
poisonous animal, where, as is generally the case, some considerable
time must elapse before the remedy can be applied. <abbr lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Parchappe,
accordingly, made several experiments upon dogs, with an extract of
nux vomica, all of which go to confirm him in ascribing to cauterization,
a power even greater than that commonly allowed it.&mdash;<q>From
these experiments it results, that the immediate amputation or destruction
in the living portion with which the extract of nux vomica
has come in contact, has the power of preventing the bad effects of
the poison, even when it has been in contact for some time.</q> The
author is aware, that there is considerable difference between the
virus of animals, and the substance used by him, with reference to
their direct and remote effects, but thinks that every one must admit
that there is a great <em>analogy</em> between them, is of the opinion, that
in both cases the poison remains in the bitten part for a considerable
time before it is transmitted to the rest of the body, and that cauterizing
should be adopted in all cases where a poisonous bite is even
suspected.</p>

<p><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>19. <i>Dental Parasites.</i>&mdash;At a meeting of the American Academy,
December 1849, a paper was read by Dr H. J. Bowditch, on the
animal and vegetable parasites infesting the teeth, with the effects of
different agents in causing their removal and destruction. Microscopical
examinations had been made of the matter deposited on the
teeth and gums of more than forty individuals, selected from all
classes of society, in every variety of bodily condition, and in nearly
every case animal and vegetable parasites in great numbers had
been discovered. Of the animal parasites there were three or four
species, and of the vegetable one or two. In fact, the only persons
whose mouths were found to be completely free from them cleansed
their teeth four times daily, using soap once. One or two of these
individuals also passed a thread between the teeth to cleanse them
more effectually. In all cases the number of the parasites were
greater in proportion to the neglect of cleanliness.</p>

<p class="moreafter">The effect of the application of various agents was also noticed.
Tobacco juice and smoke did not impair their vitality in the least.
The same was also true of the chlorine tooth-wash, of pulverized
bark, of soda, ammonia, and various other popular detergents. The
application of soap, however, appeared to destroy them instantly.
We may hence infer that this is the best and most proper specific for
cleansing the teeth. In all cases where it has been tried, it receives
unqualified commendation. It may also be proper to add, that none
but the purest white soap, free from all discolorations, should be used.&mdash;<cite>American
Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 320.</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_90" id="footnote_90"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_90">[90]</a>
These fossiliferous remains were discovered in the carbonaceous and silurian
strata of the State, and shew a wonderful development of that form of animal
on the shores during the palæozoic period. Thirty-one genera, sixteen of
which are considered by Professor Troost as new, are enumerated.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><a name="Art_17-A"></a>ARTS.</p>

<p>20. <i>The Steamboat New World.</i>&mdash;Every year sees some new
steamboat constructed, which surpasses in size, magnificence, or
speed those previously made. There is no doubt that the mechanics
of this country excel those of any other in their inland
steamboats, and it is also probable that in a few years the same
can be said of our sea-going steamships, though it must be allowed
that those hitherto produced are, with few exceptions, decided failures.
During the present year, the new steamboat <q>New World</q>
has commenced running. She is said to be the longest boat ever
put on the stocks in this country, and the longest afloat in the
world. Her length is 337 feet; extreme width, 69 feet; the
engine is 76 feet in cylinder, 15 feet in stroke, and the wheels of
iron, 46 feet in diameter. She draws 4½ feet of water. The engine
is a low pressure one, and though the boat is so very long she obeys
the helm with great readiness. Her decorations are all of the most
superb and costly character.</p>

<p>If we even attain any greater speed either in our inland or sea-going
steam-vessels, it will be principally by enlarging their size.
Though some improvements will doubtless be made in the engines
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>and in the models of the vessels, yet the great gain will be by increasing
the tonnage, for the reason that the size, and consequent
room for engines and coal, increases much faster than does the opposition
caused by the water and the air.&mdash;<cite>American Annual of
Scientific Discovery</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 30.</p>

<p>21. <i>Use of Parachutes in Mines.</i>&mdash;It is well known that vertical
ladders for descending into deep mines are very fatiguing, so that the
miners prefer to trust themselves to baskets suspended by ropes, and
in many cases the baskets are the only means provided for descending
and ascending. But accidents frequently occur from the breaking
of the ropes, in spite of all the precautions that can be taken to prevent
it. The <cite>Brussels Herald</cite> states that some experiments have
lately been made on a large scale in Belgium with a contrivance intended
to remedy this evil. The basket or cuffert is so made, that,
in case the rope breaks, it immediately springs open, forming a sort
of parachute, which is held suspended in the air by means of the
strong current which, it is well known, is always rushing up from
mines, owing to the temperature below being higher than that above.
The effect of this apparatus was shown before a numerous company,
several miners entrusting themselves to the basket, which was so
arranged that at a certain point the rope broke; they were sustained
in the air by the open basket, so that the experiments were entirely
satisfactory.</p>

<p>22. <i>Adulteration of Drugs.</i>&mdash;At a meeting of the New York
Academy of Medicine, June 1849, an elaborate report was presented
by Dr M. J. Bailey, on the practical operation of the law prohibiting
the importation of adulterated and spurious drugs, medicines, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>The report states, that since the law took effect, July 1848, over
90,000 lbs. of drugs of various kinds have been rejected and condemned
in the ports of the United States. Of these, 34,000 lbs.
was included under the comprehensive title of Peruvian bark, 16,343
lbs. rhubarb root, 11,707 lbs. jalap root, about 2000 lbs. senna,
and about 15,000 lbs. of other drugs. The agitation of the bill
which preceded the passage of the law had its effect abroad, and the
supply of adulterated drugs from foreign markets has greatly decreased.
The domestic supply, has on the contrary increased. Within
a recent period, quinine in considerable quantities has been found in
the market, adulterated to the extent of some twenty or twenty-five
per cent. These frauds were undoubtedly perpetrated by or among
our own people. The material used for the adulteration of the
quinine was found, on analysis, to be <em>mannite and sulphate of barites</em>,
in nearly equal weights. The latter article has long been used for
this purpose, but not until lately has <em>mannite</em> been detected in the
sulphate of quinine. It seems to have been ingeniously substituted
for salicine, and a somewhat similar substance prepared from the
poplar bark; which articles have heretofore been extensively used
for like purposes. The ingenuity consists in the fact, that it is
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>much more difficult to detect the adulterations when effected by the
admixture of <em>mannite</em>, than when by the admixture of salicine, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>,
while the former can be furnished for less than one-fourth of the expense
of the latter.</p>

<p>For some years past an extensive chemical establishment has been
in operation at Brussels, in Belgium, built up at great expense and
care, and expressly designed for the manufacture, on a large scale,
of imitations of all the most important foreign chemical preparations
used in medicine; while, at the same time, an agent was travelling
in this country making sales, and soliciting orders in all the principal
towns on our sea-board. The articles were prepared and put up
with consummate skill and neatness; and the imitation was so perfect
that it was impossible for the unsuspecting purchaser to distinguish
them from the genuine, notwithstanding that, in some instances,
they did not contain over five per cent. of the substances represented
by the label. Since the law went into effect at the port of New
York, not a single package has been presented for entry. Dr
Bailey states, however, that he has been informed that the persons
formerly connected with the Brussels firm, are now in this country
engaged in the same iniquitous business; hence the adulterations
spoken of.&mdash;<cite>Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 188.</p>

<p>23. <i>To restore Decayed Ivory.</i>&mdash;Mr Layard, in his explorations
among the ruins of Nineveh, discovered some splendid works of art
carved in ivory, which he forwarded to England. When they
arrived there, it was discovered that the ivory was crumbling to
pieces very rapidly. Professor Owen was consulted to know if there
was any means of preventing the entire loss of these specimens of
ancient art, and he came to the conclusion that the decay was owing
to the loss of the albumen in the ivory, and therefore recommended
that the articles be boiled in a solution of albumen. The experiment
was tried, with complete success, and the ivory has been
rendered as firm and solid as when it was first entombed.</p>

<p>24. <i>Ivory as an Article of Manufacture.</i>&mdash;There are several
sorts of ivory, differing from each other in composition, durability,
external appearance, and value. The principal sources from which
ivory is derived are the western coast of Africa and Hindostan:
Camaroo ivory is considered the best, on account of its colour and
transparency. In some of the best tusks the transparency can be
discovered even on the outside. The manufacturers have a process
by which they make poor ivory transparent, but it lasts only for a
short time. A third kind of ivory, called the Egyptian, has lately
been introduced, which is considerably lower in price than the
Indian, but in working there is much waste. By an analysis, the
African ivory shows a proportion of animal to earthy matter of 101
to 100; the Indian, 76 to 100; and the Egyptians, 70 to 100.
The value of ivory consumed in Sheffield, where it is much used in
making handles for cutlery, is very great, and nearly 500 persons
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span>are employed in working it up. To make up the weight of 180
tons consumed in that place, there must be about 45,000 tusks,
whose average weight is nine pounds each, though some weigh from
60 to 100 pounds. According to this, the number of elephants
killed every year is 22,500; but allowing that some tusks are cast,
and some animals die, it may be fairly estimated that 18,000 are
killed every year merely for their ivory, which is contrary to the
usual belief that the ivory used comes from the tusks cast by living
elephants. These estimates, it will be seen, are for Sheffield merely.</p>

<p>25. <i>Flexible Ivory.</i>&mdash;M. Charriere, a manufacturer of surgical
instruments in Paris, has for some time been in the habit of rendering
flexible the ivory which he uses in making tubes, probes, and
other instruments. He avails himself of a fact which has long been
known, that when bones are subjected to the action of hydrochloric
acid, the phosphate of lime, which forms one of their component
parts, is extracted, and thus bones retain their original form and
acquire great flexibility. M. Charriere, after giving to the pieces
of ivory the required form and polish, steeps them in acid alone, or
in acid partially diluted with water, and they thus become supple,
flexible, elastic, and of a slightly yellowish colour. In the course of
drying, the ivory becomes hard and inflexible again, but its flexibility
can be at once restored by wetting it either by surrounding it
with a piece of wet linen, or by placing sponge in the cavities of the
pieces. Some pieces of ivory have been kept in a flexible state in
the acidulated water for a week, and they were neither changed, nor
injured, nor too much softened, nor had they acquired any taste or
disagreeable smell.</p>

<p>26. <i>Air-Whistle.</i>&mdash;Mr C. Daboll, of New London, Connecticut, has
invented a whistle that speaks with a most <q>miraculous organ</q>
whenever its services are required for the purpose of alarm or warning.
It is designed for the use of vessels at sea or on the coast, as
on our eastern shores, where dense fogs prevail, and vessels are
liable to come in collision before they are conscious of each other's
approach. Its great advantage is its power of communicating sounds
for a distance of from 4 to 5 miles, far exceeding the largest bells.
An experimental one has been placed on Bartlett's Reef, and the
pilot of the <q>Lawrence</q> states that he has heard it when about 4
miles off from Bartlett's Reef, <em>against the wind</em>, which was blowing
quite fresh at the time. This was on a clear day, and when the
whistle was blown at his request, and also by advice of the inventor,
so that the distance might be marked. It is probable that, under
the same circumstances, the tones of a bell could not have been heard
more than from one half to three-fourths of a mile. The pilot of the
steamer <q>Knickerbocker</q> reports, that he <em>made the whistle</em> during
a dense fog, thirteen minutes' running-time of the steamer, before
coming up with the station where it is located. He therefore must
have been some four or five miles distant from it when he heard it.</p>

<p><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span>This whistle consists of an air chamber or condenser, of boiler iron
sufficiently<a name= "fnanchor_N33" id= "fnanchor_N33"></a><a href= "#footnote_N33" class= "fnanchor">[N33]</a> strong to resist almost any pressure, an air-pump, and a
whistle similar to the ordinary ones used on locomotives. By means
of the air-pump operating into this chamber, a pressure of air is
obtained in it of any required amount,&mdash;say one, two, or three hundred
pounds to the square inch. When the air is so compressed, it
is made to operate the whistle by simply opening a valve, and gives
a distinct clear sound.</p>

<p>A memorial has been presented to the Treasury Department,
signed by most of the commanders and pilots of the steamboats running
through Long Island and Fisher's Island Sounds, setting forth
the advantages to be derived to navigation from this whistle, and
urging that it be introduced into the light vessels, and at all stations
where the government intends to afford protection to navigation.&mdash;<cite>Annual

<p>27. <i>Curious Electrical Phenomenon.</i>&mdash;We learn from a letter
from a gentleman connected with the Bay State Mills, at Lawrence,
Massachusetts, some facts with reference to a new and curious application
of electricity which has been introduced in those mills. The electricity
is generated by the motion of the machinery, and is employed
for lighting up the gas burners. It exists in large quantities in the
card-rooms, where there are many belts running on iron pulleys, and,
in the cold dry atmosphere of winter, often producing serious damage
to the quality of the cording. The manner in which it was discovered
that this electricity could be applied to <q>lighting up,</q> is somewhat
curious. When the gas was first let into the pipes in the mills, one
of the overseers discovered fire setting out from one of the pipes near
a belt, and on examination it was ascertained that a small stream of
gas was escaping. It was surmised that it had been ignited by the
electricity, and to prove it, an experiment was tried. Near a large
belt in the carding-room was a gas-burner, and on a bench between
them there was placed a small quantity of wool, which is a non-conductor
of electricity. If a person stood upon this wool, reaching one
hand within two or three inches of the belt, and touching the gas-burner
with one finger of the other, the escaping gas was at once
ignited with an explosion like that of a percussion-cap,&mdash;the body of the
operator thus being made the medium for conducting the electricity.</p>

<p>The writer adds,&mdash;<q>We shall be able to make a great saving of
expense in the woollen manufacture, as soon as we can discover an
effective method of conducting the electricity away from the cards, as
we shall then be able to dispense entirely with the use of oil on the
wool, we shall save at least $30,000 per annum, when the mills are
in full operation.</q>&mdash;<cite>American Annual of Scientific Discovery</cite> p.
